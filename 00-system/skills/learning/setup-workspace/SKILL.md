# Setup Workspace

Guide user through workspace folder design using just-in-time organization.

## Purpose

Create a practical folder structure in 04-workspace/ based on user's actual work patterns. Follows just-in-time principle: create only what you need now, add more later.

**Time Estimate**: 5-8 minutes

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Context

**Read** goals.md for role/goals context.

**Ask**: "What types of files and content will you work with?"

Listen for: document types, client/project categories, research vs output patterns.

---

### Step 2: Just-in-Time Principle

**Explain briefly**:
```
━━━ KEY PRINCIPLE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Just-in-time organization": Only create folders you need NOW.
Don't over-organize on day 1. Structure emerges from real work.
We'll start with 3-5 essential folders.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

### Step 3: Collaborative Design

Based on role, suggest 3-7 folders. Example for sales:
```
📁 04-workspace/
├── clients/
├── proposals/
├── research/
├── templates/
└── personal-notes/
```

**Iterate** until user is satisfied.

---

### Step 4: Create Folders

Create agreed structure in 04-workspace/.

---

### Step 5: Update Workspace Map

Create/update `04-workspace/workspace-map.md` with structure and usage notes:

```markdown
# Workspace Map

> Auto-generated by setup-workspace skill
> Last updated: {date}

## Folder Structure

{folder tree with descriptions}

## Usage Notes

{any user-specified notes about organization}
```

---

### Step 6: Finalize

**Actions** (MUST complete all):

1. **Create workspace-map.md** in 04-workspace/ (if doesn't exist)

2. **Mark skill complete** in user-config.yaml:
   ```yaml
   learning_tracker:
     completed:
       setup_workspace: true  # ADD THIS LINE
   ```

3. **Display completion**:
   ```
   ✅ Setup Workspace Complete!

   Created:
   • {N} folders in 04-workspace/
   • workspace-map.md with structure documentation

   Principle: Just-in-time organization. Add folders when needed.

   Next steps:
   • 'learn projects' - Understand project workflow
   • 'learn skills' - Create reusable workflows
   • 'create project' - Start your first project
   ```

4. **Prompt close-session**:
   ```
   💡 When you're done working, say "done" to save progress.
   ```
