# Setup Workspace

Guide user through workspace folder design using just-in-time organization.

## Purpose

Create a practical folder structure in 04-workspace/ based on user's actual work patterns. Follows just-in-time principle: create only what you need now, add more later.

**Time Estimate**: 5-8 minutes

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Context

**Read** goals.md for role/goals context.

**Ask**: "What types of files and content will you work with?"

Listen for: document types, client/project categories, research vs output patterns.

---

### Step 2: Just-in-Time Principle

**Explain briefly**:
```
━━━ KEY PRINCIPLE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Just-in-time organization": Only create folders you need NOW.
Don't over-organize on day 1. Structure emerges from real work.
We'll start with 3-5 essential folders.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

### Step 3: Collaborative Design

Based on role, suggest 3-7 folders. Example for sales:
```
📁 04-workspace/
├── clients/
├── proposals/
├── research/
├── templates/
└── personal-notes/
```

**Iterate** until user is satisfied.

---

### Step 4: Create Folders

Create agreed structure in 04-workspace/.

---

### Step 5: Update Workspace Map

Update `04-workspace/workspace-map.md` with new structure and usage notes.

---

### Step 6: Complete

**Display** folder count and suggest next steps:
- "learn projects" - project planning
- "learn skills" - reusable workflows
- "create project" - start first project
