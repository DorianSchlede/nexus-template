# Learn Nexus

Achieve mastery through pitfall awareness, AI pattern recognition, and expert techniques.

## Purpose

Help experienced users avoid common mistakes, recognize AI behavioral patterns, and apply expert collaboration techniques.

**Time Estimate**: 15-18 minutes

---

## Part A: System Pitfalls (5 min)

### Pitfall #1: Projects Instead of Skills

```
WRONG:
📁 weekly-report-week-1/
📁 weekly-report-week-2/
📁 weekly-report-week-3/

RIGHT:
📁 weekly-report/  # ONE skill, used weekly

If creating "name-1", "name-2"... STOP! That's a skill.
```

### Pitfall #2: Skipping Close-Session

```
Without "done" / "close session":
❌ Progress not saved
❌ Learnings not captured
❌ Next session loses context

Always say "done" when finished.
```

### Pitfall #3: Over-Organizing

```
WRONG (day 1): 20 nested empty folders
RIGHT (day 1): 3-5 essential folders

Add folders WHEN needed, not before.
```

---

## Part B: AI Patterns (5 min)

### Pattern #1: False Progress (19% of failures)

```
AI: "Done! Files created."
(But they don't exist)

Detection:
🔍 "Show me the files"
🔍 "Read that back"
🔍 "What was modified?"
```

### Pattern #2: Incomplete Reads (40% of integration failures)

```
AI reads 100 of 500 lines, misses critical info.

Detection:
🔍 "Did you read the ENTIRE file?"
🔍 "How many lines?"
🔍 "What's at the end?"
```

### Pattern #3: Over-Engineering (16% of failures)

```
You want simple, AI builds framework.

Detection:
🔍 "Can this be simpler?"
🔍 "What's the minimum needed?"
🔍 "Start small, add later"
```

---

## Part C: Expert Patterns (5 min)

### Pattern #1: "Yes, And..." Collaboration

AI adds value beyond request. Example:
```
You: "Create sales proposal template"
AI: "I'll create it. I notice you target enterprise
     clients - should I add ROI calculator section?"
```

Evaluate additions, don't auto-accept/reject.

### Pattern #2: Intelligent Friction

Sometimes AI SHOULD slow you down:
```
You: "Create 10 projects for Q1 goals"
AI: "Before 10 projects: Which unblocks others?
     Should some be skills? Start with 2-3?"
```

Good friction prevents wasted effort.

### Pattern #3: Proactive Scanning

Expert users expect AI to LOOK before asking. Enable by:
- Keep workspace-map.md updated
- Use close-session to save context

## Part D: Mastery Check (3 min)

Quick quiz:
1. Creating "expense-report-jan", "expense-report-feb"... Fix?
2. AI says "Done! All files created." Response?
3. AI suggests complex 10-step solution. Response?

Answers:
1. ONE "expense-report" skill
2. "Show me the files"
3. "Can this be simpler?"
