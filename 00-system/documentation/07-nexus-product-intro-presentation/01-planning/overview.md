# Nexus Product Introduction Presentation

## Purpose

**Dual-audience product introduction that bridges web AI users to structured AI workflows**

**Primary Goal**: Show both audiences how Nexus solves their specific problems and provides a path to organized, persistent AI work.

**Audience A - Web LLM Users** (ChatGPT/Claude Desktop):
- Currently: No memory, restart every session, no file organization
- Problem: AI forgets everything, scattered files, repeated explanations
- Nexus Solution: Memory system, clear structure, persistent context

**Audience B - Claude Code Users** (Already using agentic coding):
- Currently: Scattered projects, inconsistent structure, no reusability
- Problem: Files everywhere, no standards, rebuilding same things
- Nexus Solution: Standardized structure, reusable skills, progressive loading

**Unified Message**: "Whether you're moving from web AI to Claude Code, or already using Claude Code with chaos, Nexus gives you memory + structure + reusability."

## Success Criteria

**How will you know this presentation succeeded?**

**Must achieve**:
- [ ] **Audience A** understands what Claude Code is and why they need it (vs web AI)
- [ ] **Audience B** understands how Nexus fixes their scattered workflow problems
- [ ] Both audiences see the 3 core solutions: Memory, Structure, Reusability
- [ ] Live demo shows memory persistence working (example: goals.md loaded next session)
- [ ] Clear transition to live onboarding provided at end
- [ ] Presentation stays within 15 minutes (10 min slides + 5 min demo)

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] Audience excited to start onboarding immediately after
- [ ] Questions answered organically during presentation
- [ ] Both audiences see themselves in the use cases

## Context

**Background**:
- Creating a generic, short-form version of the Beam presentation
- Source material: 00-system/documentation/presentation-materials/beam-presentation-10-slides-v2.md (2400+ lines, Beam-specific)
- Need: Generic version for general audience (web AI users + scattered Claude Code users)

**Stakeholders**:
- Web LLM users considering Claude Code
- Claude Code users with disorganized workflows
- Potential Nexus adopters wanting quick overview

**Constraints**:
- 15 minutes total (10 min presentation + 5 min demo)
- Must work for TWO distinct audiences simultaneously
- Must transition smoothly to live onboarding
- Keep 11 slides like source material
- Generic (not Beam-specific)

**Delivery Format**:
1. Presentation (10 min) - Show problems + solutions for both audiences
2. Live Demo (5 min) - Show memory persistence in action
3. Transition - "Ready for live onboarding? Let's start Project 00..."
