0:01 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Yeah, so for months they tell us it needs to be like this, like that. It was super complicated. Then we go there and in two days everything became so much simpler and they have decided on everything.

0:13 - Jack Li
  So, yeah, but they also didn't want to do a workshop before.

0:17 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  So, wasted two months. But that's okay. In the end it was really good. Nice.

0:40 - Anas Duksi
  Anas, you're on mute. Oh, and then I was saying, why am I saying good morning and no one is replying?  Good morning, sir. Good morning, Anas.

0:55 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  I mean, it's 8 a.m. It's 8 a.m. time, but it's night.

1:00 - Anas Duksi
  Your time, guys. should be more awake than I am. I mean, it's still nine, so we're almost there as well.

1:09 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Now I realize I came to the UK and I was like, damn it.

1:12 - Anas Duksi
  It's very early to start work while in the UK. You know, you start at 7 a.m. But, yeah. Is it all of us here or are we waiting for anyone?  see Killian, I think I've been joined. Killian mentioned he would be 30 minutes late, I assume. So, yeah. I think Killian and Asad will probably be late for 30 minutes.  So, we can get started. So, yeah. Thank you, everyone, for making the time for this workshop. I'm quite excited.  And the topic is about the onboarding. We've had been, as you know, like about... Two weeks before I took on this project, basically to work on our onboarding process.  And this came from, I I joined Beam not very long ago. And the onboarding, there's a lot of work has been done on the onboarding, which is obviously very nice.  But then we also like, as from a fresh, kind of fresh eye, if you will, you kind of do spot some issues in the process.  And then I wanted to take this. Dorian thought also that this is important. And yeah, we thought that it's probably worth working on this again.  So I'll share my screen and jump right into the, basically our agenda for today. So we can make the best out of our time.  Dorian. It started to, as a kind of four hours thing. And then we thought that we could, we could, we could do it in two hours.  And we, the reason is, I saw that there's a previous workshop that has been done, which was very, very  Very nice. I was impressed by how deep you guys got into that processes and mapping the workflows, but I thought maybe on this workshop, we built just on what we had before, so we don't just, you know, reinvent the wheel, and at the same time, we focus on the problems, really, and we keep the how for later, and we just scope the what, if that makes sense.  So that's, we have five minutes, basically, for the agenda. Our agenda will be, we're going to go through a quick recap of what I already done, just to set the tone, to see if anyone has anything to, basically, off the bat highlight, and then we're going to go over, basically, an exercise of mapping the jobs to be done.  Also, that will be, basically, based on, we're referencing here, some of the things that has already been done in the previous workshop.  And then we're going to add anything new considering where we are at now. The reason for this is we want to approach this from the point where it's not as what's the problems we're going through.  It's more what do we need? Like what do we feel we need at each step? Considering everyone in a way or another has already implemented one successful project.  So if we start from what we need, then we will be able to establish a better ground for cross-checking with what we have and then what we're missing.  Then we're going to move from there to what has been working. That's the part that I'm excited about the most.  We're going to have 25 minutes also exercise for each one of us to drop what they have built themselves to kind of cover the pains that they were going through.  Be it skills, be it like process, be it templates, workflows, prompts, agents, whatever it is, that's going to be help us.  to do then a gap analysis to see, building on the previous workshop, building on what we're doing now and what's the needs we have, and building on what we've already built, what can we do to cover that and put it in a full kind of operating system that anyone can flexibly use and add to more dynamically.  Dorian will also have, will give us like a 15, 10 to 15 minutes introduction to the Nexus system. Non-introduction actually is going to show us some magic of how that thing exactly works and then we're going to take it from there.  Yeah. Any questions on the agenda? So by the end of this workshop, we're going to conclude with a list of, you know, with a list of, of, of, of skills.  And by skills, I don't mean necessarily Nexus skills or cloud skills by. No. Jobs-to-be-done kind of things that we will think then what's the best way to build them?  Is it an automation? Is it something that a workflow that needs a lot of integration? I saw from the previous workshop that you guys got into the details.  I think it came to the point where the whole agent analytics thing started and there was the integration map.  Also workflow was mapped through that. Let me actually bring this here because I like to see people while I'm talking.  And then, yeah, we will kick off at the quick recap. So when I started, I wanted to approach this in a more analytical manner.  So I talked to, I went through the process with Dorian and then I dug into it myself on the different resources that we have.  And then I thought it's best considering that myself, I'm, I'm quite new to the company. And this is something I want to say.  But the whole workshop here, I will act more as a facilitator, really, because most of you know what's happening more than I do.  So I'll try as much as I can to be neutral and collect your guys' inputs and then just consolidate that into something useful.  So I talked to Muj, I talked to Sven, and I talked to Hassan to go through their pains. And then I mapped, I also cross-checked it from what I kind of, the pre-assumptions, I had like a list of assumptions, and I cross-checked with these and so what's basically where it is.  So I saw that we had basically three main issues, you know, around the problems happening around between, before even this, the process started.  And it's something that I wanted to kind of draw the attention of everyone to, as we map the pains in the next step is, a lot of these problems seems to me that that's happening also from what I heard from Wajan Hassan and Sven.  is that they're happening even before we start the process, between the GTM handoff and the beginning of the process.  So this is something, things around basically not having proper context, not exactly doing necessarily the right mapping of the use cases, not necessarily, even if we have a list of use cases, having the right prioritization of them, and so on.  And then we had a consensus over, if you will, that the solution needs to have more involvement into the process of deciding if this is a use case that's viable to work on, and at least have an input and opinion on that, because there are people that are going to work on this.  And then we talked about the linear template that's in the light of the basically project management overall, and how it's happening, what's missing.  I don't want to get so much into these details here, because the exercises that we're going to do are going to be the better way of actually scoping this.  But you can reference to this later. And then we talked about, we had... A strong consensus on some other issues, which is the templates that we have on Notion, that it had a low adoption rate, generally speaking, it worked for us more as a source of truth.  Some Muj, for example, mentioned that he was kind of trying to reinforce this every meeting with the clients, so they get better engagement on that.  And then we had the onboarding forum. We talked about the onboarding forum, but that's not relevant anymore because it was built in the context that where we had it done for you and done with you, where we noticed now that it's generally a done for you kind of approach with some involvement from the client, but more fully managed by ourselves.  And then we talked about the Nero template. And then I got also some input from Muj and from Sven on how the template is good more for GTM, not for us, considering it's also built in a pre-discovery, like a pre-solution.  So it's catered for more like a pre-solution stage rather than actually the actual implementation. So that's the patterns that we tracked.  That we had, yeah, sure, Jack. So we had some, the process goes as a GTM discovery, GTM proposal, and then contract is getting signed, and the GTM hands off the solutions, and we have the solution engineers discover scope issues, and then sometimes that's a pain that we have, then we have some back and forth and going back with the clients to, you know, actually do the proper scoping.  And then we finally begins actually our process, which is mapping the agent flows and getting all the inputs and outputs and so on.  Yeah, so that is a quick recap. I want to make sure that we're not going over time. If anyone has any...  Highlight here. Please just raise your hand and add to this. We're going to get into more detail as we get through the exercise.  So this is basically the what has been done in the previous workshop. And we took really the gist of like the juice of it, if you will, which is the user stories, which was, you know, quite nice to have.  So the next step, which is the jobs to be done. And as I said, I mean, we thought it is probably best to start with this and reference to what has been done in the previous workshop.  So you can take a look at this. Does this exercise going to look something like that? You can take a look at this and see if that's something you already done or as in you've already thought of and you just map it to the right stage.  Two things I want to add here is that we added this two stages. That I believe they're important to have the full picture.  One thing that I noticed that we're generally thinking in the solution as in the scope of what is within our responsibilities, as in we start with discovery, then we go to implementation, then we go to test and optimization, we go to go live.  But this is the agent life cycle building, if you will, right? Like this is how we approach building the agents.  But when we're talking about in the context of the customer onboarding, which is what this workshop is for, we need to also cater for basically what happens before that, which is basically the pre-contract assessment.  Like how is this even use case coming to our, falling into our hands? And what is happening there? What is the pains there?  Because that's what we basically most uncovered during my calls with some of you. And then we have the project set up, which is more like logistical, some like tactical steps on, you know, what do we, what do we add to the template?  We had on linear, the notion thing, you know, so that's even before we get into the discovery. Here we can have a lot of, I assume, like a lot of skills and stuff that can help in setting the, establishing the ground.  And then the discovery actually starts in our current process when we do the meeting kickoff, right? So that's where basically we start our discovery.  So one question would be how we can bridge the gap between the pre-contract assessment and the discovery. I don't want to hear to basically influence anyone's thoughts, but, you know, that's generally the tone we're talking about.  And then we have the test on optimization, we have GoLive, and then we have, after GoLive, actually, maintenance. We wanted to add, I believe, Dorian, right?  So maintenance is basically when it comes after GoLive, is we have a lot of, don't judge me, I always.  Because I have a problem with spelling maintenance. I'm not sure if anyone is like me. Okay. Okay, awesome. So basically, the maintenance has a lot to do with what you guys uncovered in the previous workshop, which is where the agent analytics came to place and the human in the loop and so on.  So without further ado, I would like to take, let me just see how much we have for this. stage.  We have 20 minutes. So I'd like to take 10 minutes, so we can conclude with five minutes. Also, again, like, let's not reinvent the wheel.  Look at this user story. See if what you have in mind already exists. Just please map it to the right stage.  And then each one of you, you know, thinks what do we, what activities that we need. One important thing before you get started, because I see some rows already jumping.  thing. One And we wanted to assess it by what things that we always need and what things that are more contextual.  And that is important in how we build the skills. So that's really important in the sense of we need to see what is the deterministic path for the solution and what is these things that are more pops up on certain client use cases and how we can cater for that.  So pick this color, the pink color for the sometimes, the one for the always, and put the jobs to be done.  Or what are the exercises? Try to answer these questions. What are the key repetitive activities or exercises that we should do at each stage of these stages?  Right? And need comes from you feel that we need this. Right? I hope it's like clear. As in not the problems that we currently have, but what do we really need to have based on your successful implementation and what you wanted.  So we can get started. started, um, already. Um, and then I would like to get your input on. The, this, this stage, this milestone stages as well.  Thank you. Thank you, Anas. So maybe one comment to make it a bit easier, right?

16:09 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Because it's a big blank canvas. Feel free to look at the user stories at the top left first, right?  To remember what we've done in the last workshop. You can also use them, drag them in, right? Duplicate them.  And then let's start filling this up. Also here to the left, we have the summary of all the problems, right?  Which might also lead to tasks. So you can use that as inspiration to think of jobs we are doing in this stage.

16:40 - Anas Duksi
  I'll start adding mine as well. Does anyone have questions?

16:49 - Hassaan Ahmed
  No, I think we'll go for now. Okay.

16:59 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  you.

17:06 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you.

17:35 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Thank you.

18:08 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Okay, we're running out of time. I think we need a few more, a few more minutes. Yeah, let's take four more minutes.  I see most of us are still... Yeah, this is the most important exercise, I think, of the workshop anyways.

30:21 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Yeah.

30:29 - Sven Djokic
  One question here. I see that I'm doing jobs to be done format, but not everybody. Like, is this needed?  Because otherwise, like, it takes a bit more time to actually follow the format for the post-its. Yeah, you don't need to.

30:45 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  We can use AI at the end of the day to construct the format. Mm-hmm. Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm-hmm.  Mm Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you.

32:08 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you. Thank Thank you. Okay, let's do two more minutes and we conclude. Okay, I think we can take it from here.  I see some of us that already got the race to the bottom. Some of us didn't make it to the last part, which is okay.  I mean, I personally intentionally left some stuff at the end, just because I don't want to influence the stages that I haven't come to yet, so to speak.  Perfect. Dorian, see you. I think you're creating some summaries? Yes.

42:44 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Okay, awesome.

42:45 - Anas Duksi
  So, to conclude on the, like, on the final part, we're mapping, basically, let me actually create also the summaries for the following stages.  I mean, I can do this.

42:58 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  You can moderate. I'll take care of this. Summaries. Okay, awesome.

43:02 - Anas Duksi
  So, I know that we want to be mindful of time, but I do really also want to hear, even in, if you will, two minutes to three minutes from each one, what their general thoughts, because I just don't want this to be just adding notes.  I want to know what's the, basically, mental model of each one in adding this and how you approach, basically, answering this as we get the summaries, and then we can check the summaries overall.  So, maybe we can do that quick, basically, recap quickly. Let's start, maybe, with Sven.

43:47 - Sven Djokic
  Let me go into the pre-contract assessment, second. So, like, the points that I have, basically, for this phase is that, on the one hand, we should always identify if this is a user.  case that we should take or not because some of the cases are just process automation and like don't need need agentic capabilities up for debate if we should then reject the projects but at least like we should try to identify if the client has not a use case that would fit like better for for the platform that we have that's the first thing apart from this we should also see like if like any of the tools we should integrate with are not feasible for for SAP would not be feasible for the POC because it's too much work but it could also be that the client is using a legacy tool that we that we cannot integrate with which we should then flag right away and like find alternatives or at least not put it into the contract.  Also we should try to reduce the scope as much as possible so that we end up with a feasible scope especially for the POC because I mean this is a bit  Hard to say since we usually don't know the use case that much yet, but at least we should try to do that next phase project set up.  What do I have? In general, we should create a linear ticket, of course, and like the project in it so that we track the progress also in Notion for the client and for us or like anywhere else.  But like somewhere we need to have like a project cracker that the client can also access if it is in Notion or like somewhere else.  Apart from this, I think what is missing as well is that we cannot share like that much documentation about the project phases, how it will work and the platform in general, which I think makes us always, always look a bit like a startup, which we are.  But it's always, it would give like more confidence if we have like slides about the phases, like all of this, that it would look like a more.  give more. More mature platform. Right. Discovery and scoping. So I think we should share like right away like to the client or earlier even what for documentation we need and from them in terms of like the like the current process and the input and the output data because without this like we can of course not like you probably the scope and build the agent.  It's like we should either ask it right away in this stage or like earlier and then as well like yeah I give a deadline or like a due date until when this has to be then like provided and like otherwise it's pushing the project timeline.  Otherwise we should of course just scope the agent flow and also we should formally have like a meeting. just Reorganized.  you Can we Which we sign off the scoped, agentic workflow that we have done them to prevent scope creep.  ERD is then optional, I think, depending on which project we have. Apart from this, identify edge cases running out of time.  So next stage, build and implement. We build, of course, we integrate the client's tools, first tests to see if the data flow is working.  Introsession with the client, I think, is always nice to show them how, like, the platform works. And I think, like, once you have the agentic workflow built, it makes more sense to have the intro session for this.  Deep dive session into building agents only if it is requested or, like, paid for by the clients. Next stage testing, setting up, like, the evils, sharing test results, weekly running frequent tests, and then also a sign-off meeting in which the client says, okay, the accuracy that we have is now enough.  For it, this could be like in person maybe as well. Otherwise, just shortly go live, training session for like the client's team that should actually use the agent, possibly planning out a sequential rollout plan.  If like it is high risk or the client is a bit worried. Last phase, monitoring tasks, especially after releases of course and customer support.  If it is us or like somebody else, but somebody has to do customer support as well. And yeah, upsell opportunities.  That's it. Sorry, bit over time. Perfect. Thank you so much, Sven.

48:41 - Anas Duksi
  So let's do this quickly in the sense that if you can just start also with like mentioning like your mental model, if you will, of how you approach basically this.  And since Sven started by mentioning a lot of the fundamentals, go through over just what you thought that. It was important to highlight other than the regular stuff that, you know, it's kind of agreed upon.  Muj, let's go with you.

49:09 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Sure. Try and keep it a bit short as well. So the idea of every phase essentially is having some prerequisites that you achieve in the previous phase before you can move on to the next phase.  So essentially planning the first phase, what you can do is you can have a look at the previous phase and see what do you really need.  And this way you can plan the previous phase by looking at the objectives of the, it's like a reverse approach of going about.  And just to give an example, if I were to define clear tickets or if I were to define clear milestones, right, I would need a good scope aligned before beforehand, you know.  So that's just giving a short example. Then if I were to look at, let's say, scoping, right, and in terms of scoping as well.  So for me to understand the project from a technical perspective, I need to do that beforehand, you know, at the time of setting up the project at the site.  to the project. So during the time of discovery, I can have understanding of what the integrations that are required, you know, I can R&D the APIs, I can look into the sample payloads, and really have a plan in my mind in terms of how I can do the, you know, conceptualize the entire flow end-to-end.  And the same logic essentially goes when you start building it. So when you're building it, before that, if you have a good understanding of the integrations that you're going to be using in the project, how you're going to be filling the variables, where you're going to be getting the data from, what the flow looks like.  So just thinking about all of this from a reverse approach to make sure that, you know, if you're building something, then your scoping needs to be well.  If you're testing something, then your build needs to be, you know, quite well. So that's the approach I think I'm looking into having everything in front of me.  I think I'll wrap it up like that. Everything else I've already mentioned. No, love that. I love that.

50:52 - Anas Duksi
  I That's exactly how I think as well about it. And I'd love to hear from as well. The rest is, it's basically, that's what  Basically, when we talk about the personalized path that everyone is going to go through, as it's going to be dependent between stages, like how you build good foundation for the first one and how you move to the second one.  I think we can conclude with some good stuff based on that, Muj. Jack?

51:19 - Jack Li
  Yeah, let me quickly. So, like I said, let me focus on some new learning from the previous new project while onboarding.  Let's try to avoid the common things we should do, make it shorter. So, first of all, like I already said, we need to define and clearly define scope, whether they have integration or not.  For example, one client asks for express POC and also with two integrations. building agent right now for me is not a problem, but building the integration, due to our platform's limitation, we don't have that comprehensive document and everything, like HubSpot integration.  It takes some time to figure out how to solve all the issues, so I believe this integration is a big discussion point, like we should be careful before we sign the contract, deal with the sales or the clients, and also the learning is when we go to the workshop with clients, they give us like this kind of a paper folder, yeah, so this digitalized, and other clients, they have everything digitalized, so API gap is almost the same, well said, there's two points, let's move into this one, I think this part, actually, I don't have anything for building documentation, you already know, yeah, analytics, I think I also talked to before, I think this evaluation, the analytics, very big, important point when we go live, but I want to spend 30 seconds on this before building the agent, so I think it's two interesting part is to, we can do the documentation before the build, and also we can provide the suggestion of variables with,  reasoning and validate before we build. Also, there's three points here. So first, in general document before we build, I need more time.  Just quickly, I really want to emphasize here, the learning. So we can, for example, like the, now we can build agent really fast.  Autocode or cursor will give you the prompt very soon. But so that's the, that's the thinking, like we can provide more things before we build the agent.  We can provide, such as we can, we can write down how we build the agent, what goes next. the documentation errors before we build.  Also, one thing is for another client is they don't have any idea how, how, can take up what they want to extract.  So we can help them. We can provide the variables and the reasoning export to error table to show them this information we get from this document.  And this is why we decide this resume is set or not all this information. Like we can build a POC in pretty fast and show them they can come back and reverse everything.  Another last thing, We also need to have some discussion, like how they're going to use AI outputs in their workflow.  After we deliver this, what they're to deal with this. Because by understanding with the clients, they don't have too much clear understanding, and they just give us a requirement, which is a gap in their own process for next step.  So if we can understand what they're going to deal with this, we can help them refine the requirement, rebuild the agent much more better.  But sometimes they don't understand what they're going to deal with this. So they give us a bunch of requirements, which they will need.  So yeah, that's my learning before you, Aiden.

54:38 - Anas Duksi
  Awesome. Very good point. Thank you, Jack. Let's move to Hassan. Yeah, I think generally quite a few things have been covered.

54:50 - Hassaan Ahmed
  But one of the things that I feel quite important is that we need to sort of differentiate between at the point in the pre-contract process.  to the in process. And then The kickoff point, we need to differentiate between what the kickoff date is and what actually is the date of when we're receiving the documents, because that's like a gap in there.  For the client, if they're having a kickoff call, let's say on the 1st of November, they're like, okay, a project has started.  In three months, the POC will be done. But they will provide us information on the 20th of November. Then that's essentially 20 days that we lost in terms of what the process is.  And that is a gap in there that we sort of need to bridge. And this would be bridged because we sort of tell the sales team or we collaborate with the sales team and say the kickoff date is actually once we have all the documentation, we have all the accesses to their systems, because that is when we get at least the input materials, because that is when we sort of can start with building the agents itself.  Because until then we essentially building skeletons and all, but not properly sort of getting deep dive into it. And then the second one, I would say, again, maybe a couple of people mentioned, think you also mentioned it.  With integrations and stuff, Jack also did. And then the second one is integrations, because a lot of the times, the bigger the organization, the difficult and more sticky it is to get access to their integrations, because let's say, even if it's not SAP, even if it's Zendesk or something with financial information, and we're dealing with such a use case in accounts receivables, then they'll have to take permissions from 10 places to share the account receivable information with us.  Hence, delaying the process and all, right? So having the accesses to those integrations, and then also understanding how that works.  I think those are the two couple of things that I think we need to sort of in-build, and this is all before actually the start building process, it started.  But I think that's what I had to add.

56:45 - Anas Duksi
  So you mean, Hussan, understanding how basically the integration works with the client themselves, as in what's their process for obtaining information on the integration?  Yeah.

56:56 - Hassaan Ahmed
  And also getting the access to it, because even if we understand how it works. Most of the times, every client uses a separate integration.  So we need to get access to their systems so that we can actually have the agent working. Sure.

57:09 - Anas Duksi
  Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you, Hassan. I don't think Killian is here. So maybe we can move to Fahad quickly.  Okay.

57:20 - Fahad Imdad
  So initially, before the pre-contract, we have to go through the agent itself that it is possible to make it on Beam or not.  And can we really automate it using Beam or not and completely understand the whole context of the agent. And when we are scoping, we should draw a complete visualization of the agent, say like how the whole flow would be going before creating on the Beam platform as well.  And then when we move towards it, we can like prompt it properly because most of the difficulty we face.  example, I need we'll is due to incorrect prompts and AI cannot understand the context of it and cannot work properly according to it.  So yeah, we could, if we face any failures, we could enhance the prompt and we should make sure that we get consistent results if we are not getting consistent results on each run.  So we should enhance the prompt and should make it in a way that we should get same results or consistent results every time.  And so, and if we go live and we face any failure, so we should identify the reason for the failure and we should fix it immediately.  Right. Awesome. Perfect.

58:46 - Anas Duksi
  Good points. I think, yeah. So most of these are in the fundamentals of the basic domain approaches, which is good to reinforce resource.  There Let me go quickly to Safi. Hi.

59:06 - Hassaan Ahmed
  So, yeah, I think most of the points are already covered by other people. So I would just go about what I wrote here.  So first of all, in the pre-contract state, I think we should fully understand the client. again, Fahad also mentioned it, that we should fully understand the client requirements and map them if we are able to replicate them in our platform.  And if not, then we can communicate it to them and buy some more time. And then, again, the second most important step is to gather and organize the test cases from the client and basically figure out, okay, so how do we have to build it for it to properly work for the client?  And then also, which Hassan also mentioned, that we have to properly define the status of the project with the client.  So this is the big update. then, so from this time, we are going to build on it. So everything is clear, deadlines are not mixed up.  And then once the project is started, so we can start with the documentation set of the plan project and map all the linear tickets, etc.  And then once we are into the discovery and scoping of the project, so we can, the first of the things that we do, we should do is like, we should identify the outliers in the dataset and figure out which cases can make us stuck in the workflow.  And then sort of tune our workflow according to those outliers. And then figure out also like, figure out integration requirements that we would need to complete this project.  And then also like, we need to like properly define the outcomes of the agent, like what it should achieve and how it should achieve that.  And what should be the end goal of the agent. And then when we are like building and implementing it, we should like create nodes and edges and like all the stuff.  And then. Once we are like in the testing and optimization, we should like thoroughly test on the sample data provided by the client and figure out if generally working on it and also like share the updates regularly with the client so like there is a visibility that we are making some progress and we are stuck or if we need some more like test cases from the client, we can ask for them.  And then also we need to like properly define the emails and so that we can optimize our tools as Fahad also already mentioned that we need to like optimize our problems because a lot of the functionality depends on around the good prompting.  So yeah. And then once the agent go live, we can like we should like monitor the agent continuously. So if any new bugs are alive that we did not cater initially, so we can like work on them and like properly fix those issues and then roll out the newer versions incrementally and like also like inform the clients about the recent bug fixes so that the client gets.  That we are continuously monitoring it and working on the project until it is like properly delivered with all the cases passing.  So yeah, these are my two cents. Perfect. Thank you, Safi.

1:02:12 - Anas Duksi
  I will finalize with Dorian. So Dorian, if you can walk us through what is mainly if there's anything additional or what you haven't also on touch on the final part on the summary, then we will take a 10 minutes break.  And then we come back to the next exercise. Sure.

1:02:34 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  So I mean, I don't want to repeat all the stuff maybe about what I've noticed now from what you guys said, right?  So I see that there's a lot of stuff happening pre-sale. So in terms of defining the requirements and doing the scoping, right?  We get a lot of surprises in the projects. That's what I have noticed from what you said. And I wouldn't want to go through the summary now.  but you can't. Not all good. So anyways, then, so yeah, this gap analysis is really important, right? Which should happen, but which doesn't always happen.  So I put it to always, but in reality, it doesn't always happen. Then, I mean, maybe one more thing I noticed.  I was thinking about what everybody is doing in the different phases. And I see that we sometimes do things in different phases as well.  For example, the test cases, right? They should, for example, they should, collected before the project. But I kind of had to put it into the project kickoff, into the pre-contract assessment, and into the discovery and scoping, sometimes into the built-in implement as well.  So I did realize that we don't always have a clear point where we do certain things, which is a little bit of an issue.  And then I also realized that some things we should So Thank always be doing, but not everybody is always doing them.  So that's also something I saw. In terms of more content, I think most of the stuff has been said.  think two things I want to point out is the reporting. So sending reports to clients on the accuracy. Right?  I didn't hear this a lot from you guys, but I think because this is something we don't do at the moment, but I think this is something we should be doing more often.  Yeah. Other than that, I think we had essentially everything. Yeah. Perfect. Then thank you so much, everyone, for the input.

1:04:48 - Anas Duksi
  Very interesting stuff. Let's take just a 10 minutes break and then we come back. I think what's next up is that we have the...  What has been working? So I'm going to organize the notes so we can go through how each one of you approached some of these problems and fixed them.  And then we're going to move into a quick demo on the Nexus skills with Dorian. And then we map what the jobs that we need to do.  Basically, just a gap analysis between what has been built already, which we can leverage across the team, what's missing.  And then we do quick prioritization of the main things that we can cover. And we list them basically as action items to consider basically how we can implement them.  I think having said that, we'll probably tip off basically the two hours mark. So if everyone is okay doing 30 more minutes, then that would be great, considering we spent quite a good time.  on the basically the discovery. So yeah, that will still be an achievement considering we're not doing for four hours.  But yeah, good stuff. Let's take 10 minutes and be back. Anas, will you stay here?

1:06:15 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Should we quickly jump to like this? Yes, yes, I'll be here. Thank you.

1:16:00 - Hassaan Ahmed
  Everybody here. Where's Mr. Assad? Is he still sick?

1:16:13 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  No. Apologies for being late, first of all.

1:16:18 - Kilian Sorg
  I had an urgent Pfizer call with Assad together. We launched the HITL application this morning and as always, unfortunately, there are some bugs that snuck through.  So Assad is working on this right now and won't be able to participate because this is very urgent. But I'm here now and it looks really, really cool.  I'm making my way through the notes. Really, really awesome. Perfect.

1:16:42 - Anas Duksi
  Perfect. No worries, Dorian. Sorry, Gillian. Thanks for joining and glad to hear that you actually launched the HITL. I'm sure Assad is doing a great job now fixing this.  Now, so let me actually go back. Where we started. So yeah, what we did, just like very quickly, we did an exercise of building on the previous workshop where you did like a problem mapping.  So we put these as a reference. We included what already is still valid. And then everyone added their points and a new kind of slightly different, like a slightly like a new approach to the basically the milestones, as in we added two milestones that to cover basically the problem space, which is the pre-contract assessment and the project set up.  And then we start the discovery, as in, this is our scope for building the agent. And this is the scope for the project onboarding as of all, which includes some other stakeholders in it.  Like for example, the GTM team and bringing stakeholders from the client side to assess. So, so that's what we're going to do now is we're going to go over, I think, obviously, Kilian, you can also participate, you can participate with us.  I mean, moving forward, because that's going to be still relevant. Most of the kind of collective work. So we're trying to scope everyone's problems into these basically summaries.  And what we're going to do is we're going to vote. So we're going to vote on each one of us will have five votes at each section, at each milestone, right?  The vote is not like a graded vote. Just vote on what you think. Pick the red color only. You don't need to pick the red color.  Actually, we're going to do the actual voting system. So choose what you, out of five of these cards, what you believe is the most painful that needs to be prioritized for work.  As we do this, we will take these basically the ones that are highest, with highest votes, and we're going to do the exercise of the, you know, the solution space and how, what has been built and what we can do to solve them.  Project Planning, Dorian, I think you have a new categorization?

1:19:05 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  I found a new feature in Miro, which kind of does exactly what we wanted, but better, so. Okay, here you go.  Solution Discovery, Project Planning, the workflow.

1:19:19 - Anas Duksi
  Okay, so the categorization, oh, that's amazing. Yeah, it's much better than the one I tried before.

1:19:27 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Is this also AI-based? Yeah, yeah, look, mark, like, multiple post-its, highlight multiple post-its somewhere. No, not, yeah, whatever. No, you can just highlight multiple post-its, and then there is an AI button, and then there is, like, an organized function.  But, yeah. That's very cool.

1:19:51 - Anas Duksi
  Okay, so let's try to do this exercise in 10 minutes, the voting. So I'll highlight this section for you, and I'll enable it.  We're votes in two minutes. So you can go through the notes. This is where, you know, just to highlight, we're in the pre-contract assessment.  So we're going to do it for each stage. Highlight what you believe is the most important. So we get consensus over that and then we move forward.  I'll click on start and then you will receive. Is everyone aligned on the definition of important now?

1:20:26 - Kilian Sorg
  No, I, important means that we are now deep diving into it in a, in the next step, right? Important means most painful takes most time should be optimized first.  Okay. And we are voting on posted level or on cluster level? Posted. Got it. And how many votes do we have?  One? Five. Let's go. Five. Yeah.

1:20:47 - Anas Duksi
  And high, and also just add, have the highest impact on later stages as well. So always think in the whole milestones connected together.  Okay.

1:20:57 - Kilian Sorg
  Start it.

1:21:06 - Anas Duksi
  Thank Thank you. Okay, it's actually quite cool. So, looking at the votes here, we got, actually, we got the align, I'll just go through the highest ones just for the sake of time, and then when we finish, we can take the highest ones directly to the next stage.  Yeah, we have six votes for the align on clear success criteria to measure project outcomes effectively, which is interesting to come in the pre-contract assignment.  mean, have performed gap analysis capabilities, and then we have clearly defined the scope of the agent with... The client and line expectations include solutions team early on.  Makes sense. I personally voted on all of these. So, okay, cool. Let's move to the next one, which is the project setup.  If anyone has any questions or anything is unclear, please be vocal. Okay. Starting on project setup. Let's go. I'm adding one minute.  Just, I know that's a lot of notes. So, you guys, take it. Thank you.

1:24:37 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Thank you. We made the post-its worse. We had much better post-its before I threw it into the AI, I think.  Actually, I'll redo this and take the actual post-its instead of, yeah, do that one sec.

1:25:19 - Anas Duksi
  Yeah, guys, let's be like really also hard to say critical about this, right? If something is very vague and high level, I'm not trying to influence your votes, but like, you know, skip it to something that is more actionable, let's say, yeah.

1:25:49 - Kilian Sorg
  We can add multiple votes on the same note? I don't think so, no. I mean, yes, Miro allows you, so why not?  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. yeah. Okay, I didn't know.

1:26:01 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Yeah, mean, if you were allowed, why not?

1:26:08 - Anas Duksi
  That's a good one. I didn't know that.

1:26:16 - Kilian Sorg
  That's maybe do not want in two volts on one post, otherwise one person can push. Yeah.

1:26:30 - Anas Duksi
  Yeah, found this one a bit tricky. I'm not sure about you guys, but yeah, we have seven votes for documentation, clear up for data details, tenders and client and operations.  Okay, fine. Test cases.

1:27:08 - Kilian Sorg
  Nice.

1:27:12 - Anas Duksi
  So, Dorian, you mentioned that you reverted to the previous posters? Yeah, so this is the actual things we had.  I just now grouped them instead of having AI transform them.

1:27:25 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Yeah, okay, cool. So are we ready to move to the next step?

1:27:32 - Anas Duksi
  Yeah. Okay, let's do it. So now we're at discovery and scoping. This is quite important, so I'll add three minutes for it.  All right. All right. Here we go. right. right. Thank Let's go.

1:28:53 - Hassaan Ahmed
  I think because this is the non-AI one, there's quite a lot of overlap between some of the post-its. Yeah, but we can group as well, so with the score, so that's okay.

1:29:39 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow, is it three minutes not over yet or? Okay, yes. Something got eight.  It's API documentation and understand input outputs. Each API we need. Not surprised. Collect on resources beforehand. Okay. So I think here we also have eight.

1:31:36 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  It's just then what Hassan said, kind of the same thing multiple times. So this conceptualize and scoping is like the same thing with two all the time.  Yeah, okay.

1:31:53 - Anas Duksi
  So I mean, we can group them. That's okay. All right. We're at Build and Implement. Is the time okay?  Are you guys able to kind of skim through the notes first? So it's okay or do we need to add one more minute?  I think it's fine. Okay. Good to hear. I'll do two minutes for this. There's not a lot of notes.  Implementation. It's fine. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.

1:34:08 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Thank you.

1:34:39 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you. Okay, we're done on this one. This is a bit tricky, it was a bit tricky to me, but we will come to it.  Yeah, I know that I'm stressing this a lot, but it's very important that we think in terms of what we need, but also what we can solve for, right?  As in, what is it that we can build out of this that can be fixed? So I see a lot of this stuff that is helpful as a guidance on what happens.  fixed. important, be then do this we it's So, this Right? So some of these are answering what happens during the build, not as what we need, you know, that comes from a pain, which is fine, I guess, because we can still zoom on and so on and so on.  Especially that, like, me, myself, for example, I'm also, some people have been here longer, so they don't know the problems more, and I think that the voting will help us here get to where we want to get.  Okay, let me go to the next stage. We're testing and optimization.

1:36:37 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  I honestly think, Anas, it's things that we need to do, but it's also pain points at the same time.  Yes, I see nothing. Yes. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right.

1:37:07 - Anas Duksi
  Thank Thank you. Thank you. So yeah, I would always recommend skimming first through all the cards just so you don't consume your votes and then you find something important.  Thank you. Perfect. We are at the final two stages. Yeah, we should be okay to finish this in four minutes.  So let's get right to it. Okay. Okay. Perfect. We are at the final two stages. Yeah, we should be okay to finish this in four minutes.  So let's get right to it. Okay. Okay. Thank Thank you. I feel like I would like to add more votes here.

1:42:56 - Hassaan Ahmed
  Very nice.

1:43:00 - Anas Duksi
  I've got I've got my card and I was wishing that I would get the highest scores actually that it's funny.

1:43:07 - Hassaan Ahmed
  So basically, I was just want to clarify one thing. Whoever added this one, if you can quickly what what do you what do you mean by the fixed data transfer issues?  Who owns this card? We can just have a look. Because you can show the author. What? Is it me?  Ah, no, it's not me. I just duplicated all the posters at the beginning. Now it's you, Dorian. Now it's me.  I mean, I guess it's from you, Hassan, because you have this problem right now. I do, but I did not put it in.

1:43:55 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Okay. But I have the problem. Explain it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you We're putting them on spot on this.  We're not calling you out on this, so it's okay. No, no, no. So what I'm facing in terms of data transfer is that even if we want to go live, there's constant new sort of requirements that are coming in.  And then we need to have a central repository where we sort of transfer, put in one data and now we've transformed it.  And how do we keep on versioning of that data in terms of improvements? And then also there are client stages in the sense that, for example, client has a staging environment.  And then the client has a production environment.

1:44:31 - Hassaan Ahmed
  So now I have to, I create one agent for the staging environment and now transfer all this data to the one, one agent for the staging environment.

1:44:40 - Anas Duksi
  Now I have to transfer all this data to a production environment where maybe the only changes the API key we're sending out there too.  So that's the issue that I am facing at least in this regard, but not sure what the context was, uh, for whoever voted much.  Yeah, so I have second Hassan on this one and a very recent example is when the client. And... was when we were doing some testing and the client reported that, hey, the agent said the account was never found and that's incorrect.

1:45:06 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  So before even checking anything, I told the client to see if they're reverting to the sandbox or production because we're working on sandbox right now.

1:45:13 - Anas Duksi
  And they're like, oh, yeah, we were referring to production. So this is a very valid point that initially we deploy on, let's say, sandbox, and then we move everything to production.

1:45:24 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  And there could be some changes that should be expected along the way.

1:45:30 - Anas Duksi
  Okay. Now that I see, now that I explained, maybe I should have voted as well. You didn't even know you own the card.  Did we give this one a veto? Okay, I think it's important. So I think we're actually trying to scope whatever is important.  So if you guys face this, I will give it a green from my end. Considering I'm the moderator, I do get to do that.  Okay, cool. Voters? Sorry? You don't get to vote? No, I said I get to vote to have a veto over what to say.  All right. Yes, let's do the final one, which is the maintenance, which is the new stage that we currently are considering.  If anyone has a more class word than maintenance, then we can use that as well. mean, but maintenance is maintenance, you know?  So I'll start. Let's go. So I'll Let's go. Thank you. Okay, so we're done with the voting. Oh, Dorian.  That's very helpful. So you already added the ones that are highly votous to the next frame. Let me actually add the other ones quickly on the design optimization so we can directly start on the next exercise.  I can do that. In the background. Okay. So from what I see now on the pre-contract assessment, we have three, four, six, eight, and then we have here as well another six.  So I think we're going to get a lot of cards. the idea here, guys, is that what we're going to do now is we're just going to try to use these, which we came off, obviously, through the progress of getting what we need, and then scoring.  So them to see what basically we can, two things, really what we want to do in this exercise. First, what have you done in order to go around or to solve these problems or to meet those needs?  And the second question is, ideas on what do you think we can do in order to solve those problems?  Be it, you know, again, like a skill, a workflow, how do you suggest, and obviously, we're not, we're not going to get into the, you know, nitty gritty of the full workflow or anything.  It's just like how, what would you think is the best approach or way to solve this? After we do that, we're going to basically see what has already been built.

1:50:52 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  actually, let me do one thing. Let me highlight this one, similar to how we did with sometimes and always.  So use the I'll the basically, let me use a better color for this, use the blue one, or how you solved, or go around, let's say, work around more accurately, around it, and then how you suggest basically to solve this, you use this purple basically sticker.

1:51:25 - Anas Duksi
  Sure.

1:51:29 - Kilian Sorg
  We're going to try to be more quick considering we have 40 minutes left. And I think the sections that we have are more kind of, you know, now leaning and organizing what we need to work on.

1:51:42 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Are we done, Dorian, on the basically tasks? Yes. I'm just wondering now if we should assign to the individual pieces, right?

1:51:53 - Kilian Sorg
  Because now it's kind of in a bucket. So if we now just create how to fix in the row.

1:52:00 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  We don't know which one it relates to you. You see my problem?

1:52:08 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  You know what I mean? If we just put it in the rows now, we don't know where it relates to.

1:52:13 - Anas Duksi
  So maybe we should have a relation of the, what have I done to the actual post-it itself? Yeah, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure. I get that. If I now put a post-it with a solution, how do you know to which green post-it this relates?  Oh, right, right, right, right. So we just put them all not in horizontal, but vertical, and then you can just put it in the same row, maybe?  Does that make sense? I mean, it's kind of ugly, but... Should we just maybe duplicate the green post-its into each column, and then we just add it directly on top or something?  Yeah. We can also do that, but I think think then... Okay, up to you. It's a bit harder to read.  Let's do it in the raw logic. Yeah, yeah. So what I was thinking, I see where you're coming from, but what I was thinking actually is, because eventually what we need is just to have this map, right?  And we can create the report out of this map. So I thought like they can pick it from there directly, right?  So pick this thing and then change its color and then comment on it, on how it has been solved.  But then we will, we will need to do a lot of work on the grouping. Then yes, I think this makes more sense.  Yeah. Maybe again, let's go group by group. And while we go through, I'm just doing this quickly. And let's, let's try to think about this like more quicker, as in you either did something about it or you didn't.  And you either have an idea about it or you haven't. Right? So that's okay both. But I know a lot of you has already been doing a lot of good practices around that.  That's what that's why we're trying to scope. Let me try to also do. Okay, so I think we can start with the first category, right?  Yeah, let's do that. Is the idea is clear, guys? Let's have like 15 minutes for this.

1:54:25 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Where you go over each of the cards and you include the purple card, if you have a suggestion for how to, what process, what skill, what workflow you would build to solve this, or if you have solved it already, what was your approach and what was your process, and also in a few sentences.  And then we can get comments from everyone. So, yeah, let's get started. I'll add a timer.

1:55:08 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you.

1:55:32 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Thank you.

1:56:07 - Anas Duksi
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank Thank you. Thank you. You might as well just think of the, I think that's important of the both like functional and non-functional kind of solutions, right?  So if you include something like, for example, a demo meeting to do something or a meeting with team, you might as well think of maybe we need to create a skill that can help in that particular part of the pre-contract assessment as well.  So things are down those lines as well because I know that you have been creating things like that. So things like that.  So things like that. So that. So things that. like So things So things So things that. things like that.  things that. So that. So things So like that. So Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're muted, Anas.  Oh, okay. So I added four more minutes as I saw Mojin and Sven finishing some stuff. We have 30 seconds going, but I think we already have a lot of very good stuff.  We have a masterpiece in here. So, Anas, I don't know what you think, but I think now I would actually love to go through them one by one because I think everybody has such great ideas, right?  But I also think if we do this now, it might be a little bit too much for today. So I was thinking maybe we just do another session next week where we actually go through all the ideas and everything one by one.  We kind of prepare everything we have so far and then we could have like a focused discussion. All of them?  Or do you want to do this now? this Or do I think... Yeah, I was looking at basically what we have out of here, and we have a lot of things to go through.  So I was thinking around the same lines, as in maybe we should do quick, maybe Dorian, should do the quick nexus part in the 10 minutes that we have left, and then we schedule another session to, because we will need also to have the time to kind of organize this into something that is consumable more, that we can get actions out of.

2:19:31 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  I saw that Jack and Muj took a very interesting approach in, you know, connecting some pieces to each other, which is going to be tricky if we spend the 10 minutes we have left to kind of untangle, because it seems that it's very insightful.  So, do you think we can do the nexus then part now? And if everyone is okay, we can conclude with that, and we can schedule another session where we will have digested this to build a more action.  Basically, items off of it. Does that sound good? Sure. Okay. Let me just take a quick look again on what we have.  Nice, nice, nice. Okay, Dorian, I'll give it to you to talk about the nexus part, and we can finalize with that.  Sure. So, I mean, I would like to give this like a proper introduction, maybe next week, right, where we take an actual hour.  But for now, I'm just going to give you a quick glimpse and explain the value of it, I think.  So, let me share my screen and just give you a high-level example. So I'm just going to start, let's say, very high level.  So what is this thing at all, right? So it's essentially just folders with context that you can put on your computer.  And it's just folders and a bunch of files. But now with the agentic coding, this is really powerful because essentially you can turn all your folders, all your files into context for the AI.  And you can also make the AI execute your files, essentially. So a document becomes an executable thing that your AI agent can run.  And then on top of this, they have given the AI the ability to call tools on your computer, like reading files, writing files, moving files, searching through files on your computer.  And with this, the AI can then, for example, do things like load different files. to get context on what you want to do, right?  And this is like the meta skills that Entropic has given to the AI. Now, that's the toolkit, essentially. Now, the question is, what can you do with this, right?  So what I have built here is essentially a generic system that everyone can use that allows you to build your own project.  Now, you might be wondering, why do you need this? Why can't you just use plain Claw code, right? The reason is with that plain Claw code never knows what you're doing, right?  You will always start from scratch. Also, you don't have any way or you need to figure out your own way of organizing information, right?  And also, if you've used the Vibe coding stuff before, you will see that it generates thousands of documents all over the place, right?  And it doesn't really know which. It put the documents, it doesn't know how to delete them, it doesn't know how to organize.  So if you start your own Vibe Coding Project without anything, it gets a mess extremely fast, right? And also you might not know the best patterns of how to work with the AI, right?  Because most people just say, I want to do this and then let the AI implement, but that will not get you the best results.  The best results will come if you use the AI to research and plan, right? And then once your plan and your research has been done well, you don't need to look at the execution because the AI will execute perfectly.  So I'm not overseeing execution anymore, I'm only overseeing the planning. So I'm like constantly planning with the AI collaboratively, I'm not implementing anymore.  So that's where you can get. Now, maybe quickly on the Nexus system and how we can use that. So as you see here, there is...  Four core folders here that this thing has. One of them is the system layer, which is essentially the whole system functionality in the background that's very generic that allows you to build anything that you want, right?  It's essentially orchestrating the whole functionality of the system. Then you have a memory layer, which is essentially always loaded.  So whenever you start a new chat, it always loads the memory so that it knows what you're working on, what you have done in the chat before.  It also knows your goals. It knows your roadmap of your project. So this way it becomes really smart because it knows exactly what you're doing whenever you start a new session.  And your memory starts from an empty state at the beginning, then you do one session with the Nexus system where it defines your goal.  And then in the second session, it will already know what you want to do. And then you kind of evolve your memory over time so that the AI is always in sync with your project status and with what you want to do.  Then there is projects. Projects is essentially an area where you plan with the AI and have like a bounded context zone.  So memory is like persistent through all your sessions and the project is like a specific thing that you want to do with the AI where you want to, which is more complicated, which you cannot implement right away, right?  Where you want the AI to actually plan and research your existing files and plan with you and then you execute later on.  This allows you to optimize essentially the context management, right? Because if you plan, have the AI research, you do back and forth, and then you do implementation in the same chat, you're not going to get greater results.  results. not to So you want to split this up. You want to have a research and planning session with the AI where you go back and forth, and then you have a crystal clear plan, and then you take it to a new session, and then you implement the crystal clear plan in a new session.  And this will allow the AI to give you much, much, much, much better results. So yeah, I'm just doing the planning.  The execution is, let's say, 80% of the time I don't need to interfere anymore. I can just let it run for 20 minutes, and then it does exactly what I want.  And this is what you want to achieve, because if you can get the AI to a stage where you plan the whole thing, and it just executes end-to-end for you, this is where you become hyper-efficient, especially then when you standardize what you're doing.  And this leads me to the next one, which is skills. So skills is essentially a job to be done.  So this is essentially what we have defined, or tried to define today. This is the things that you need to do.  Which is essentially a sequence of steps, right? So when we need to onboard a new client, we have a sequence of things that we need to do.  We might need to create the linear project, create the Notion page, we might want to analyze the transcripts from the sales calls, we might want to get all the data from the sales from HubSpot, right?  So this is a job that we need to do. So that means you can convert it into a skill.  And what a skill is, is essentially just a sequence of steps and then a list of additional references and files and also scripts or MCP tools, whatever you want, that support this workflow, okay?  So yeah, it essentially encapsulates everything that you need to complete one task. So yeah, and maybe regarding the previous concept, right there, had tasks, workflows, rules, checklists.  So that was a lot of different concepts. And I found that... This was too complicated to understand as a beginner.  So this is why we now have the skill concept, which combines everything, and you don't need to know the differences of all the entities.  So this makes it very easy. And what we want to do now with this Nexus system down the line, one more thing, these skills are really good because they are essentially bounded to one thing.  So essentially, if I want to give you this skill, I can just give it to you. And then you put it into your folder on your computer, and then you can do it yourself.  So, for example, what I have here is a graph slicer, right? Maybe I can quickly... No, let me finish on the high level, and then I'll show you one example.  So this is a skill that I built that I can give to you. So essentially, I just need to give you the folder.  Then you put the folder onto your computer, and then you also have the graph slicer. And you also have a skill to document your notes for the client automatically.  a readлет at the only public. And Right? And this is now how everybody can build their own skills and then share it with everybody else.  Right? And this way, we can build up a library very fast to automate all our jobs. Right? Which was not possible in the old Nexus system because it was distributed across multiple places.  So that's why it was difficult. Now it has become very easy. And I think in the next session, what we will want to do is from all the things, all the ideas, all the things we already have, we can then derive a list of skills that we will want to build.  Maybe even we assign owners for these skills. And then everybody goes off, create these skills, and then we start sharing them.  So this means that we essentially have 10 people to automate each other's work. Yeah. So that's essentially what we're doing.  And then once we aggregate all these skills, right? You can use the Nexus system to create your own project.  So I have scoped this Nexus system to my bid project, right? So the goal is to create all the bid agents, you know, to create all the documentation for bid and everything.  And now, once we have hundreds of skills later, I will just have a huge S library of, let's say, 20, 30, 40 skills that I can just use however I want to, to automate the work of doing the client project.  So that's the whole idea of this Nexus system. One more, one last thing. There's a workspace folder, which is where you do your client-specific or your, let's say, project-specific stuff.

2:30:44 - Anas Duksi
  So this is where you can build up your own, your own, your own way of organizing information, essentially, with one layer on top.  It's built in a way that the AI will. always know what files are where and how to navigate your own workspace.  So that's the only thing I added on top. So you build your own folder structure, you build everything yourself.  What I'm doing on a system level is creating a map for the AI so that it can navigate your workspace, which you don't get by default.  So if you work on the default, you generate a bunch of files, but the AI doesn't know what to use and when to use which file and where to put information.

2:31:27 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  So this is what I've also built on top for everybody. Yes. Yes. That's another Nexus system. I can do like one quick demo if you want.  Otherwise, I'd say questions if you have any.

2:31:40 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Yeah. Thank you so much, Dorian. I think that's a good introduction to this, to the whole thing. And then I think in our next session, we can also get into more examples.  just to be mindful of time.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule next week's onboarding workshop w/ Dorian, Anas, Jack, Sven, Hassaan, Fahad, Kilian, Asad - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Xw_oJ91uAGSxs3Wph1Z7sVRNky-gvssx?timestamp=9123.9999

2:31:59 - Sven Djokic
  Just If anyone has any questions, please, I mean, share them. Otherwise, I think this has been a very good session.

2:32:07 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  I know we went over time with 30 minutes, but we got really good stuff to work on, which is what matters.  I'll reach out to schedule the next session also next week.

2:32:18 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  So in a time that works for all of us. And with that, I'll wrap up. Yeah, please go. Sorry, one thing regarding the accounts, because I just saw that they removed my premium account.  So are we able to now share the cloud code accounts? I mean, I set one up and I shared it with Akib and I think Sven.

2:32:45 - Jack Li
  So let me just quickly check if it's working for me.

2:32:50 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Yeah, I think it is. So we're using it.

2:32:53 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Sven, are you also using the same account I set up? So I still have my other one, but I will switch.  Also then to it, I think it's working, like, because I have on Zoho the password, so, you know, I should be able to log in.  Okay, Dorian is working for me, I just checked. I'm pretty sure Akeb is using it as well, so yeah.

2:33:15 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  Okay, I don't have Premium Account anymore, it seems, even though I'm...

2:33:22 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  Jack? Jack is not here, is he? Jack, do you have Premium still? Or Asad? Yeah, I think I still have Premium subscription yet.

2:33:31 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  I'm not very sure when I'm to get lost. No, I don't have it, so maybe they kept your subscription, so could you please share this with Kilian, Asad, and me today?

2:33:44 - Jack Li
  But how can I do this?

2:33:45 - Anas Duksi
  This is with my, like, PMAI account. I mean, Mushtaba just did it, so Mushtaba, how did you do it?  So I basically created a Gmail account, like a private Gmail account, and then I shared it with Rabia, and she essentially...  You just activated the pro account and yeah, that's it.

2:34:04 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  And then everything's up and running. You can then create the password and everything involved and share it with your team members.

2:34:09 - Dorian Schlede (beam.ai)
  So you just create a Gmail account. That's it.

2:34:11 - Anas Duksi
  Pro account means 20 euros or the full one, the max one? No, no, the max one. Sorry, not the pro one.
  ACTION ITEM: Post Cloud Code sharing steps in solution-discussion; then Jack share pro acct w/ Kilian, Asad, Dorian - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/Xw_oJ91uAGSxs3Wph1Z7sVRNky-gvssx?timestamp=9255.9999  But I didn't create the account. I mean, I didn't get the cloud code or anything. I just created a Gmail account, gave it to Rabia.  She did the rest. So pretty simple for us. Okay. Could you write this down in the solution discussion channel?

2:34:30 - Mujtaba Ahmed
  So that, yeah, thank you. then Jack, could you please do this ASAP?

2:34:33 - Fahad Imdad
  Because otherwise we're all blocked. Yeah, I just created a new account and asked them to convert that one. Yeah, okay.  Yeah, I can do this. Okay. Yeah, I still have that issue myself because I'm not in Germany. Yeah, you're not in anyone's...  Yeah, you're completely missing. We can discuss that separately, Dorian, Anas, if you want. Yeah. Okay. Okay, well, thanks. Thanks, everyone, for your time.  Thanks, team. Really nice work. And we'll meet you next week. Thank you. Bye. Thank you, Mark. Thanks a lot.  Bye. Thank you so much, Anas. It was a great session. no problem. Thank you, Mark. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.
