## Folder Structure

```
04-workspace/
└── (not configured yet)
```

**After running 'quick start', this will contain your personalized structure.**

## Example Structures

The quick-start skill will create folders based on your role and work patterns.

**Example for a Developer:**
```
04-workspace/
├── projects/           # Active coding projects
├── research/           # Technical research & notes
├── docs/               # Documentation drafts
└── sandbox/            # Experiments & prototypes
```

**Example for a Consultant:**
```
04-workspace/
├── clients/            # Client-specific folders
├── proposals/          # Business proposals
├── research/           # Market & competitor research
├── templates/          # Reusable documents
└── deliverables/       # Final outputs
```

**Example for a Researcher:**
```
04-workspace/
├── papers/             # Academic papers & sources
├── experiments/        # Research experiments
├── data/               # Datasets & analysis
