├── docs/               # Documentation drafts
└── sandbox/            # Experiments & prototypes
```

**Example for a Consultant:**
```
04-workspace/
├── clients/            # Client-specific folders
├── proposals/          # Business proposals
├── research/           # Market & competitor research
├── templates/          # Reusable documents
└── deliverables/       # Final outputs
```
