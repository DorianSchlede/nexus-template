# Research Briefing: ta-llm-methods

## Research Question

What are the best practices for LLM-assisted thematic analysis?

## Fields to Extract

For each paper's `index.md`, extract:

- **topics** - Main subject areas and themes covered
- **methods** - TA methodologies, frameworks, techniques used
- **llm_techniques** - LLM/AI techniques (prompting, fine-tuning, agents, etc.)
- **evaluation_metrics** - How quality was measured (kappa, cosine similarity, human eval)
- **key_findings** - Main conclusions, results, insights
- **limitations** - Stated limitations, constraints, gaps
- **relevance_triggers** - Query terms that should surface this paper

## Focus Areas

Prioritize sections covering methodology, evaluation approaches, and LLM integration.

## Skip Sections

Acknowledgments, author bios, funding statements.

## Synthesis Outputs

After all papers analyzed, generate:

1. **_synthesis_methodology_comparison.md** - Compare TA methodologies across papers
2. **_synthesis_llm_best_practices.md** - Extract best practices for using LLMs in TA
3. **_synthesis_gaps.md** - Identify research gaps for future work
