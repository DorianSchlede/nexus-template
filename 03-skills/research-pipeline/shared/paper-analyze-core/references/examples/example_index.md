# Using thematic analysis in psychology - Analysis Index

## Paper Overview

- **Source**: Braun_Clarke_2006_Using_TA_Psychology.pdf
- **Chunks**: 4 chunks, ~23,400 estimated tokens
- **Analyzed**: 2025-12-16T14:30:00

## Key Extractions

This foundational paper establishes thematic analysis as a legitimate qualitative method in psychology. Braun & Clarke argue TA is "poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used" and provide the first comprehensive methodological guide.

### Topics
- Thematic analysis as a method (not just a tool within other methods)
- Epistemological flexibility (realist to constructionist)
- Distinction from content analysis and grounded theory

### Methods
- **Six-phase approach** (Chunk 2): Familiarization → Initial coding → Searching for themes → Reviewing themes → Defining and naming → Producing report
- **Semantic vs latent themes** (Chunk 1): Surface meaning vs underlying assumptions
- **Inductive vs deductive** (Chunk 1): Data-driven vs theory-driven coding

### Key Findings
- "Themes do not just 'emerge'" - researcher makes active choices (Chunk 3)
- Flexibility is both strength and weakness - must be explicit about decisions
- Inter-rater reliability useful but not essential for good TA (Chunk 3)

## Chunk Navigation

### Chunk 1: Introduction & Theoretical Foundations
- **Summary**: Introduces TA as an undervalued method, positions it relative to other qualitative approaches (IPA, grounded theory, discourse analysis). Discusses epistemological considerations - essentialist/realist vs constructionist approaches. Defines semantic vs latent themes.
- **Key concepts**: [thematic analysis definition, epistemological flexibility, semantic themes, latent themes, qualitative methods comparison]
- **Load when**: "What is thematic analysis?" / "How does TA compare to grounded theory?" / "What are semantic vs latent themes?"

### Chunk 2: The Six-Phase Methodology
- **Summary**: Detailed walkthrough of the six phases of TA. Phase 1: Familiarization with data. Phase 2: Generating initial codes. Phase 3: Searching for themes. Phase 4: Reviewing themes (candidate themes against data). Phase 5: Defining and naming themes. Phase 6: Producing the report.
- **Key concepts**: [six phases, familiarization, coding, theme generation, theme review, theme definition, recursive process]
- **Load when**: "How do I do thematic analysis?" / "What are the steps of TA?" / "How to code qualitative data?" / "How to identify themes?"

### Chunk 3: Quality Criteria & Common Pitfalls
- **Summary**: Discusses what makes good TA - consistency, coherence, researcher reflexivity. Lists 15-item checklist for quality. Addresses common mistakes: themes that are just topics, overlap between themes, weak data support. Discusses inter-rater reliability.
- **Key concepts**: [quality criteria, checklist, common pitfalls, inter-rater reliability, researcher reflexivity, theme coherence]
- **Load when**: "How to evaluate TA quality?" / "What are common TA mistakes?" / "Is inter-rater reliability needed?" / "TA quality checklist"

### Chunk 4: Advantages, Disadvantages & Conclusion
- **Summary**: Summarizes benefits (flexibility, accessibility, useful for policy) and limitations (less interpretive power, flexibility can be weakness). Advocates for TA as valuable method that deserves clearer recognition. References section.
- **Key concepts**: [TA advantages, TA limitations, theoretical flexibility, accessibility, applied research]
- **Load when**: "What are the pros and cons of TA?" / "Why use thematic analysis?" / "TA vs other methods advantages"
