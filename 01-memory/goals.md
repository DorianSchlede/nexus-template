## Goal

Automate LinkedIn - build a system that generates leads through consistent, strategic content without the daily grind.

---

## Success Looks Like

Leads coming from LinkedIn - DMs, inquiries, and business opportunities flowing from content.

---

## Current Friction

Coming up with ideas - blank page syndrome makes each post a struggle to start.

---

## Context

You want LinkedIn to work FOR you, not be another task on your list. The system should handle the hard part (ideas) so you can focus on showing up authentically. The end game isn't vanity metrics - it's actual business results.
