## Current Role

Co-founder at Mutagent (pre-launch), focused on hypothesis validation, ICP definition, and customer interview analysis for an AI agent optimization platform.

---

## Short-Term Goal (3 months)

100+ customer interviews to validate hypotheses + 5 pilot customers

**Why This Matters**:
Build and test more hypotheses - de-risk before building, find real PMF through evidence. Product is ready in 2 weeks, but the focus is on understanding the problem and pain first.

**Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 100 interviews completed
- [ ] Hypotheses validated/invalidated (D1, D2, D9, V1 + new ones)
- [ ] 5 pilot customers using MVP
- [ ] Clear ICP definition based on data

---

## Long-Term Vision (1-3 years)

Not prioritized at this stage - focus is on validation first.
