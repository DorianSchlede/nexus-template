# Instructions for AI

When this file is loaded (every session via --startup):
1. Respect the language preference throughout ALL interactions
2. Use timezone for accurate session timestamps
3. Format dates according to user preference
4. Check learning_tracker for onboarding skill suggestions

If smart_default is true:
- System is using default templates (not personalized)
- Suggest onboarding skills when contextually appropriate
- User can work immediately without setup

If language is not set (empty string):
- Default to English
- Prompt user to set preference during setup-memory skill
