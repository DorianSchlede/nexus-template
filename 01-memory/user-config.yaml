# Instructions for AI

When this file is loaded (every session via --startup):
1. Respect the language preference throughout ALL interactions
2. Use timezone for accurate session timestamps
3. Format dates according to user preference
4. Check learning_tracker for progressive disclosure suggestions

If language is not set (empty string):
- Default to English

## Learning Tracker Usage

**WHO updates WHAT**:
- nexus-loader.py → session_count (incremented each startup)
- Each learning skill → completed[skill_name] = true when finished
- Orchestrator → dismissed[], last_suggested (when user dismisses suggestions)
- close-session → can add insights to core-learnings.md

**Suggestion Preference**:
- off: Never suggest learning skills
- minimal: Suggest only when directly relevant
- normal: Balanced suggestions based on context
- proactive: Actively suggest uncompleted skills
