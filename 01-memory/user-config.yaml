# Instructions for AI

When this file is loaded (every session via --startup):
1. Respect the language preference throughout ALL interactions
2. Use timezone for accurate session timestamps
3. Format dates according to user preference
4. Check onboarding status to determine next session

If onboarding status is "in_progress":
- Load the next onboarding session based on current_session value
- Session 1: 00-define-goals
- Session 2: 01-first-project
- Session 3: 02-first-skill
- Session 4: 03-system-mastery

If language is not set (empty string):
- Default to English
- Prompt user to set preference during next onboarding step
