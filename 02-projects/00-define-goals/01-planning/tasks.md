# Tasks: Get Started (Project 00)

**Project ID**: 00-define-goals
**Onboarding Step**: 1 of 4
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 minutes

---

⚠️ **CRITICAL FOR close-session SKILL**:
This file contains **16 REAL TASKS** with checkboxes (- [ ]) that MUST be marked complete (- [x]) when work is done!

---

## Design Philosophy

**Key Principle**: CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT

We start by capturing YOUR goals (concrete), create your memory workspace (action), then explain what happened (understanding). You learn by experiencing, not by listening.

---

## Execution Instructions for AI

**Critical Principles**:
- NO system state complexity in first 30 seconds
- Goals and discovery happen FIRST (concrete)
- Memory creation happens SECOND (action)
- Explanation happens THIRD (abstract, now grounded)

**Vocabulary Limit**: Only 4 terms this session (Memory, Goals, Sessions, close-session)

**Context Loading**: None (first project)

**Output**: goals.md, roadmap.md, user-config.yaml, project-map.md, core-learnings.md, session-reports/

    - Say: "Before we dive into goals, quick question:"
    - Say: "Do you have any documents about your work that could help me understand your goals better?"
    - Say: "• Business plans, project docs, strategy memos, etc."
    - Say: "This is 100% optional, but can help me give better suggestions!"

  - Step 3: Pause and wait (15 sec)
    - Say: "Want to share any context documents now, or should we continue?"
    - Say: "• Type '@filename' to share (I'll wait!)"
    - Say: "• Or say 'continue' to move on"
    - **WAIT** for user response
    - IF user shares file:
      - Read and analyze the file
      - Say: "Great! I can see [filename]. I'll use this to better understand your goals."
      - Extract relevant context (role, domain, goals, challenges)
      - Store for use in Section 1 suggestions
    - IF user says "continue" or "skip":
      - Say: "No problem! We'll capture your goals through conversation."
      - Say: "You can always share documents later with @filename."

    ```
    Nexus-v3/
    ├── 00-system/          ← SYSTEM (I manage this - don't modify)
    │   ├── core/           ← Core scripts and infrastructure
    │   ├── skills/         ← System skills (close-session, etc.)

  - Say: "This structure keeps everything organized and prevents confusion."
  - Time: 1 minute

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Explain what just happened
  - Say: "🧠 Here's what makes this special:"
  - Say: "What I just created is YOUR MEMORY."

  - Say: "But Nexus is different: these files persist across sessions."
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Show the value
  - Say: "Tomorrow, when you return, I'll automatically load these files."
  - Say: "I'll remember that you're a [USER_ROLE]"
  - Say: "I'll remember your goal to [SHORT_TERM_GOAL]"
  - Say: "You'll never have to re-explain yourself."
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Connect to their goal
  - Say: "This memory is the foundation for everything else."
  - Say: "Next session, we'll use these goals to create your workspace structure."
  - Say: "Everything we build will serve YOUR goal: [SHORT_TERM_GOAL]"
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Task 4.4**: Introduce terminology (4 terms only)
  - Say: "Quick vocabulary:"
  - **Memory**: "These files that persist across sessions"
  - **Goals**: "What you want to accomplish (we just defined yours)"
  - **Sessions**: "Each time we work together (like right now)"
  - **close-session**: "How we end sessions properly (you'll learn this next)"
  - Say: "That's all the vocabulary for today—just 4 terms!"
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Task 4.5**: Explain session concept
  - Say: "Let's clarify what a 'session' means in Nexus."

  - Say: "They're not 'set it and forget it'—they grow with you."
  - Say: "As your goals evolve, you update goals.md"
  - Say: "As you learn patterns, core-learnings.md grows"
  - Say: "Think of them as your persistent knowledge base that improves over time."
  - Time: 30 seconds

- [ ] **Task 4.7**: Explain scope concept
  - Say: "One last concept: Your memory defines your SCOPE."
  - Say: "If you're working on your SaaS product → load this Nexus instance"
  - Say: "If you're working on a different client → create a separate Nexus instance"
  - Say: "Each major context gets its own memory. This prevents mixing unrelated work."
  - Say: "But within ONE context (like your SaaS), memory persists across all sessions."
