    quote: a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey
      knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and
      whose edges represent relations
  description: Formal definition of a knowledge graph as a data structure where nodes
    represent entities and edges represent relations between entities. This establishes
    the fundamental entity-relation paradigm that underpins all knowledge graph structures.
- name: Data Graph Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:77-82)
    quote: a data graph as a collection of data represented as nodes and edges using
      one of the models discussed in Section 2. We refer to a knowledge graph as a
      data graph potentially enhanced with representations
  description: Distinguishes data graph (raw structure) from knowledge graph (data
    graph enhanced with schema, identity, context, ontologies, rules). Establishes
    that knowledge graphs are layered structures with a data graph foundation.
- name: Entity Node Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:140-142)
    quote: whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations
      between these entities
  description: Nodes in knowledge graphs represent entities - real-world things of
    interest. This is the fundamental building block for entity representation in
    graph-based knowledge structures.
- name: Datatype Nodes (Literals)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:712-720)
    quote: Most practical data models for graphs allow for defining nodes that are
      datatype values. RDF utilises XML Schema Datatypes (XSD), amongst others, where
      a datatype node is given as a pair (l,d)
  description: Datatype nodes (literals) represent typed values like strings, integers,
    dates. They consist of a lexical string and a datatype IRI. These nodes cannot
    have outgoing edges and represent atomic values rather than entities.
- name: Blank Nodes (Existential Nodes)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:779-806)
    quote: some graph models permit the use of existential nodes... These edges denote
      that there exists a common venue... without identifying it. Existential nodes
      are supported in RDF as blank nodes
  description: Blank nodes represent anonymous entities whose identity is unknown
    or unspecified. They support modeling incomplete information by asserting existence
    without identification.

      of their parents
  description: Classes define natural groupings of entities sharing common characteristics.
    Classes can form hierarchies through subclass relationships, enabling type inheritance
    and categorization.

    quote: children are defined to be subclasses of their parents such that if we
      find an edge EID15 type Food Festival... we may also infer that EID15 type Festival
      and EID15 type Event
  description: Subclass relationships create hierarchical taxonomies where membership
    in a child class implies membership in all parent classes. Enables type inference
    through class hierarchies.

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:120-127)
    quote: we may also wish to define the semantics of edge labels, aka properties.
      Returning to Figure 1, we may consider that the properties city and venue are
      sub-properties of a more general property location

    quote: We may further define the domain of properties, indicating the class(es)
      of entities for nodes from which edges with that property extend... Conversely,
      we may define the range of properties
  description: Domain specifies the class of subject entities for a property; range
    specifies the class of object entities. These constraints enable type inference
    from property usage.

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:481-484)
    quote: OWL further allows for defining relations to explicitly state that two
      terms refer to the same entity, where, e.g., Region V same as Region de Valparaiso
      states that both refer to the same region
  description: Same-as relations declare that two different identifiers refer to the
    same real-world entity. Essential for entity resolution and data integration across
    knowledge graphs.
- name: Different From Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:485-487)
    quote: two terms refer to different entities, where, e.g., Valparaiso diff. from
      Region de Valparaiso distinguishes the city from the region of the same name
  description: Different-from relations explicitly declare that two identifiers refer
    to distinct entities. Disambiguates entities that might otherwise be confused
    due to similar names.

      of properties) such that pairs of entities related by the chain are also related
      by the given property
  description: 'Property chains define composite relations: if X-p1-Y-p2-Z, then X-p3-Z

  description: Interpretation maps data graph terms to a domain graph of real-world
    entities and relations. The domain graph follows the same model as the data graph.
    Foundation for formal semantics.

    quote: we will speak of directed edge-labelled graphs and refer to the nodes of
      the domain graph as entities, and the edges of the domain graph as relations
  description: 'Critical distinction: nodes are syntactic elements in data graphs;
    entities are semantic elements in domain graphs. Multiple nodes can map to one
    entity. Edges map to relations.'
- name: Open World Assumption
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:404-411)
    quote: under the Open World Assumption (OWA), we cannot be certain that this relation
      does not exist as this could be part of some knowledge not (yet) described by
      the graph
  description: OWA assumes that absence of information does not imply falsehood. Unknown
    statements could be true or false. Standard assumption for incomplete knowledge
    graphs.

  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:413-415)
    quote: under the Unique Name Assumption (UNA), the data graph describes at least
      two flights to Santiago (since Vina del Mar and Arica are assumed to be different
      entities)
  description: UNA assumes different identifiers denote different entities. Simplifies
    reasoning but prevents recognizing that two terms refer to the same entity without
    explicit same-as assertion.

- name: Syntactic Accuracy Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:27-28)
    quote: Syntactic accuracy is the degree to which the data are accurate with respect
      to the grammatical rules defined for the domain and/or data model
  description: Defines syntactic accuracy as a quality dimension for knowledge graph
    entities. This relates to entity definitions by establishing that entities must
    conform to defined schema rules (e.g., datatype compatibility, proper formatting).
    Relevant for validating entity properties against ontological constraints.
- name: Semantic Accuracy Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:50-51)
    quote: Semantic accuracy is the degree to which data values correctly represent
      real world phenomena, which may be affected by imprecise extraction results
  description: Defines semantic accuracy as the correspondence between data entities
    and real-world phenomena they represent. Critical for entity definitions because
    entities must accurately model their real-world counterparts. Highlights that
    entities can be syntactically valid but semantically incorrect.
- name: Timeliness Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:68-70)
    quote: Timeliness is the degree to which the knowledge graph is currently up-to-date
      with the real world state
  description: Defines timeliness as a temporal quality dimension for entities. Entities
    may become semantically inaccurate over time if not updated. This introduces a
    temporal aspect to entity definitions - entities have temporal validity that affects
    their accuracy.
- name: Completeness Definition (Schema, Property, Population)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:97-107)
    quote: Completeness refers to the degree to which all required information is
      present... schema completeness, property completeness, population completeness,
      and linkability completeness
  description: 'Defines four types of completeness for entity coverage: schema completeness
    (classes/properties represented), property completeness (values present), population
    completeness (real-world entities captured), linkability completeness (instances
    interlinked). These sub-dimensions define what makes an entity definition complete.'
- name: Representativeness Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:120-124)
    quote: Representativeness is a related dimension that, instead of focusing on
      the ratio of domain-relevant elements that are missing, rather focuses on assessing
      high-level biases
  description: Defines representativeness as the assessment of biases in entity coverage.
    Entities may be incomplete in systematic ways (geographic, linguistic, social
    biases). This affects how entity definitions should account for sampling bias
    in knowledge graphs.
- name: Consistency Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:168-169)
    quote: Consistency means that a knowledge graph is free of (logical/formal) contradictions
      with respect to the particular logical entailment considered
  description: Defines consistency as freedom from logical contradictions. Entity
    definitions must be internally consistent - entities cannot simultaneously belong
    to disjoint classes or have contradictory properties. Ties entity definitions
    to formal logic and entailment.
- name: Validity Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:179-181)
    quote: Validity means that the knowledge graph is free of constraint violations,
      such as captured by shape expressions
  description: Defines validity as conformance to shape constraints. Distinct from
    consistency (logical contradictions), validity concerns constraint satisfaction.
    Entity definitions can be validated against shapes specifying cardinality, value
    ranges, and structural requirements.
- name: Conciseness Definition (Intensional/Extensional)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:202-208)
    quote: Conciseness refers to avoiding the inclusion of schema and data elements

      extensional conciseness (data level)
  description: 'Defines conciseness at two levels: intensional (no redundant schema
    elements like properties/classes) and extensional (no redundant entity instances).
    Entity definitions should avoid unnecessary duplication and irrelevant elements.'
- name: Understandability Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:243-247)
    quote: Understandability refers to the ease with which data can be interpreted
      without ambiguity by human users, which involves... the provision of human-readable
      labels and descriptions
  description: Defines understandability as interpretability by humans through labels
    and descriptions. Entity definitions must include human-readable metadata for
    disambiguation. Multilingual support enhances understandability across language
    contexts.
- name: Knowledge Graph Completion Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:295-299)
    quote: knowledge graph completion aims at filling in the missing edges (aka missing
      links) of a knowledge graph, i.e., edges that are deemed correct but are neither
      given nor entailed
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:127-134)
    quote: The first category simply defines the knowledge graph as a graph where
      nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between those entities
  description: Merged from 2 sources. Defines knowledge graph completion as predicting
    missing relationships between entities. Entities in knowledge graphs are inherently
    incomplete, and completion techniques infer new edges (general links, type links,
    identity links) to enhance entity connectivity.
- name: Type-Link Prediction Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:337-345)
    quote: Type links are of particular importance to a knowledge graph, where dedicated
      techniques can be leveraged taking into account the specific semantics of such
      links
  description: Defines type-link prediction as classification of entities into semantic
    classes. Type links assign entities to classes (e.g., City, Person) based on features
    like edge patterns. This is fundamental to entity definition - determining what
    kind of entity something is.
- name: Identity-Link Prediction Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:358-364)
    quote: Predicting identity links involves searching for nodes that refer to the
      same entity; this is analogous to the task of entity matching
  description: Defines identity-link prediction as determining when different nodes
    represent the same real-world entity. Uses value matchers (comparing attribute
    similarity) and context matchers (comparing neighborhood structure). Critical
    for entity consolidation.
- name: Fact Validation Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:426-428)
    quote: The task of fact validation (aka fact checking) involves assigning plausibility
      or veracity scores to facts/edges, typically between 0 and 1
  description: Defines fact validation as scoring the plausibility of entity relationships.
    Facts about entities can be validated against external sources (structured or
    unstructured). Relates to entity definition correctness - ensuring stated relationships
    are accurate.

    quote: Reusability refers to the ease with which the dataset can be re-used in
      conjunction with other datasets... richly described with a plurality of accurate
      and relevant attributes
  description: Merged from 2 sources. Defines findability as locatability through
    unique identifiers and rich metadata. Entities must have globally unique, persistent
    identifiers (F1) and be described with searchable metadata. IRIs in RDF provide
    this identification scheme for entities.
- name: FAIR Principles - Accessibility Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:648-658)
    quote: Accessibility refers to the ease with which external agents (once they
      have located the dataset) can access the dataset... retrievable by their identifier
      using a standard protocol
  description: Defines accessibility as retrievability via standard protocols with
    authentication support. Entities must be accessible through open protocols (HTTP),
    with metadata remaining accessible even when data is unavailable. Relates to how
    entity definitions are exposed.
- name: FAIR Principles - Interoperability Definition
  sources:

    quote: Interoperability refers to the ease with which the dataset can be exploited
      (in conjunction with other datasets) using standard tools... use an accessible,
      shared, and general knowledge representation formalism
  description: Defines interoperability as exploitability using shared formalisms
    and vocabularies. Entity definitions should use FAIR-compliant vocabularies and
    include qualified references to other data. Ontologies serve as the knowledge
    representation formalism.
- name: Linked Data Entity Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:737-745)
    quote: Use IRIs as names for things. Use HTTP IRIs so those names can be looked
      up. When a HTTP IRI is looked up, provide useful content about the entity
  description: Defines entities in Linked Data as named with HTTP IRIs that can be
    dereferenced to retrieve entity descriptions. The four Linked Data principles
    establish that entities should be identified (IRI), locatable (HTTP), described
    (useful content), and linked (references).

      world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent
      relations between these entities
  description: Defines knowledge graph as a data graph where nodes are entities representing

      a knowledge base? The phrase knowledge base was popularised in the 70s... rule-based
      expert systems
  description: Defines knowledge graph entities in terms of knowledge bases from expert
    systems tradition. Entities exist within a knowledge base that may include ontological
    structures and rules. Links entity definition to formal knowledge representation
    traditions.

      organized in a graph; defines possible classes and relations of entities in
      a schema
  description: Defines entities as organized under a schema that specifies possible
    classes and relations. From Paulheim's criteria - entities are grounded in class
    hierarchies and relation types. This distinguishes knowledge graphs from unstructured
    graphs.

      of nodes, L is a set of edge labels, and E is a subset of V x L x V is a set
      of edges
  description: Formal definition of entities as nodes V in a directed edge-labelled
    graph. Entities (nodes) are connected by labeled edges from the set E. This mathematical
    definition underlies RDF and most knowledge graph implementations.

      maps each node to a label'
  description: Defines entities in heterogeneous graphs as nodes with type labels.
    Each entity node is mapped to a type label, enabling typed entities (e.g., City,
    Country). This extends basic graph model with explicit entity typing.

      node or edge id to a set of property-value pairs'
  description: Defines entities in property graphs as nodes with IDs, labels, and
    property-value pairs. Entities have rich attribute structures beyond just labels.
