      knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and
      whose edges represent relations
  description: The foundational entity type in knowledge graphs is the 'Entity' -
    nodes represent entities of interest and edges represent relations between entities.
    This defines the core duality of entity-relation modeling in knowledge graphs.
