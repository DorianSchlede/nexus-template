patterns:
  - name: "W3C PROV Standard Extension"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:119-121)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends the W3C PROV [7] standard and incorporates concepts from the Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
    description: "PROV-AGENT extends the W3C PROV provenance standard to capture AI agent interactions. W3C PROV provides the foundational Agent-Activity-Entity triad and relationships (used, wasGeneratedBy, wasAssociatedWith, wasInformedBy) that PROV-AGENT builds upon."

  - name: "Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:144-150)"
    quote: "MCP defines core agentic AI development concepts, including tools, prompts, resources, context management, and agent-client architecture that can communicate with external sources"
    description: "MCP is emerging as an industry and academic standard for agentic AI development. It defines concepts like tools, prompts, resources, and context management. PROV-AGENT incorporates MCP terminology (AgentTool, AIModelInvocation) to represent agent actions."

  - name: "Flowcept Open-Source Provenance Framework"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:321-324)"
    quote: "we extend Flowcept [9], an open-source distributed provenance framework designed for complex, heterogeneous workflows spanning experimental facilities at the edge, cloud platforms, and HPC environments"
    description: "Flowcept is the implementation platform for PROV-AGENT. It provides a federated, broker-based model for streaming raw provenance data from instrumented scripts, data observability hooks, and workflow tools."

  - name: "Python Decorator Instrumentation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:343-351)"
    quote: "applying the @flowcept_task decorator ensures that, upon execution, the function's inputs, outputs, and any generated telemetry or scheduling data are automatically captured"
    description: "PROV-AGENT uses Python decorators (@flowcept_task, @flowcept_agent_tool) for non-invasive instrumentation of MCP tools. This pattern automatically captures provenance without modifying the core tool logic."

  - name: "LangChain Integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:359-364)"
    quote: "a generic wrapper for abstract LLM objects, compatible with models from popular LLM interfaces, including CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI"
    description: "PROV-AGENT provides FlowceptLLM wrapper that integrates with LangChain, enabling provenance capture for LLM invocations through the langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI interface."

  - name: "OpenAI API Compatibility"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:381-399)"
    quote: "from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI... llm = FlowceptLLM(ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o'))"
    description: "The implementation demonstrates integration with OpenAI's API (gpt-4o model) through LangChain's ChatOpenAI wrapper, wrapped by FlowceptLLM for provenance capture."

  - name: "Redis and Kafka Data Streaming"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:329-331)"
    quote: "data streaming services and storage layers such as Redis, Kafka, SQLite, file systems, and object stores while the workflows run"
    description: "Flowcept supports multiple data streaming backends (Redis, Kafka) and storage systems (SQLite, file systems, object stores) for runtime provenance capture in distributed environments."

  - name: "Dask and MLflow Integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:328-329)"
    quote: "data observability hooks in workflow tools (e.g., Dask, MLflow)"
    description: "PROV-AGENT integrates with Dask (distributed computing) and MLflow (ML lifecycle management) through data observability hooks, enabling provenance capture from existing workflow tools."

  - name: "Streamlit GUI for Provenance Queries"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:372-377)"
    quote: "Flowcept also provides an MCP agent with a Streamlit GUI that enables users to interact with the provenance database through natural language queries at runtime"
    description: "A Streamlit-based graphical interface allows users to query the provenance database using natural language, enabling runtime exploration of agent decisions and workflow traceability."

  - name: "AutoGen Multi-Agent Framework"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:141-142)"
    quote: "LangChain [10], [11], AutoGen [12], LangGraph [13], Academy [3], and CrewAI [14] support multi-agent systems that interact through prompt exchanges"
    description: "PROV-AGENT is designed to work with multiple agentic workflow frameworks including AutoGen, LangGraph, Academy, and CrewAI, all supporting the MCP standard."

  - name: "CrewAI Framework Integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:141-144)"
    quote: "CrewAI [14] support multi-agent systems that interact through prompt exchanges, calls to foundation models typically hosted by AI service providers in the cloud"
    description: "CrewAI is listed as a compatible framework for PROV-AGENT, supporting multi-agent systems with cloud-hosted foundation models. The FlowceptLLM wrapper is compatible with CrewAI interfaces."

  - name: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Support"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:148-150)"
    quote: "communicate with external sources, such as knowledge bases or web pages, for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [15] to dynamically augment prompts"
    description: "MCP and PROV-AGENT support RAG patterns where agents communicate with knowledge bases or web pages to augment prompts, with this context captured as part of the provenance graph."
