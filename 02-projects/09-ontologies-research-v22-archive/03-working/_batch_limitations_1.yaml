patterns:
  - name: "Graph Model Inflexibility Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:382-399)"
    quote: "Along the way, the board has to incrementally change the schema several times in order to support new sources of data. Each such change requires..."
    description: "Relational models require costly remodelling, reloading, and reindexing when integrating new sources - graphs offer more flexibility but still face modelling challenges when data scope is unknown a priori"

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Definition Contentiousness"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:132-137)"
    quote: "The definition of a 'knowledge graph' remains contentious, where a number of (sometimes conflicting) definitions have emerged, varying from specific..."
    description: "Lack of unified definition for knowledge graphs creates ambiguity - definitions range from specific technical proposals to inclusive general proposals, limiting interoperability and shared understanding"

  - name: "Heterogeneous Graph Type Restriction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:496-502)"
    quote: "Conversely, they typically only support a one-to-one relation between nodes and types, which is not the case for del graphs"
    description: "Heterogeneous graphs only support one-to-one relation between nodes and types, unlike directed edge-labelled graphs which allow nodes with zero or multiple types"

  - name: "Open World Assumption Query Limitations"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:213-221)"
    quote: "it is inconvenient if a system is unable to definitely answer 'yes' or 'no' to questions such as 'is there a flight between Arica and Vina del Mar?'"
    description: "Open World Assumption prevents definitive negative answers - systems cannot confirm absence of relations without Local Closed World Assumption (LCWA) for specific graph portions"

  - name: "Shapes Recursion and Negation Paradox"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:336-357)"
    quote: "shapes languages that freely combine recursion and negation may lead to semantic problems, depending on how their semantics are defined"
    description: "Combining recursion and negation in shapes validation leads to paradoxical situations (barber paradox), requiring special semantics like stratification, partial assignments, or stable models"

  - name: "RDF* Contextual Grouping Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:82-92)"
    quote: "The least flexible option is RDF*, which, in the absence of an edge id, does not permit different groups of contextual values to be assigned to an edge"
    description: "RDF* cannot pair contextual values for the same edge - e.g., cannot distinguish two presidencies with different valid time periods on the same edge without creating intermediate nodes"

  - name: "Manual Context Query Tedium"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:101-109)"
    quote: "writing a query to manually intersect the corresponding temporal contexts will be tedious - or may not even be possible at all"
    description: "Without annotation frameworks, reasoning about context (e.g., temporal intersections) requires tedious manual queries or may be impossible with standard query languages"

  - name: "Ontological Entailment Undecidability"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:895-901)"
    quote: "deciding if the first entails the second... is undecidable: no (finite) algorithm for such entailment can exist that halts on all inputs with the correct..."
    description: "Full OWL entailment is undecidable - practical reasoning requires either incomplete algorithms, restricted feature sets, or potentially non-terminating procedures"

  - name: "Rule-Based Reasoning Incompleteness"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:46-52)"
    quote: "these rules are likewise incomplete as such rules cannot fully capture negation (e.g., Complement), existentials (e.g., Some Values), universals..."
    description: "OWL 2 RL/RDF rules cannot fully capture negation, existentials (Some Values), universals (All Values), or counting (Cardinality), limiting expressiveness of rule-based reasoning"

  - name: "Cyclical Pattern Inference Prohibition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:114-118)"
    quote: "as they do not support ways to infer relations from cyclical graph patterns (for computability reasons)"
    description: "Ontology features cannot infer relations from cyclical graph patterns due to computability constraints - rules must be defined independently for such patterns"

  - name: "Description Logic Computational Complexity"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:203-209)"
    quote: "Due to their prohibitive computational complexity - where for example, disjunction may lead to an exponential number of branching possibilities..."
    description: "Expressive Description Logic reasoning strategies (e.g., tableau methods) have prohibitive computational complexity, especially with disjunction, making them unsuitable for large-scale data"

  - name: "Materialisation Size Explosion"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:60-64)"
    quote: "depending on the rules and the data, the materialised graph may become unfeasibly large to manage"
    description: "Rule-based materialisation can produce graphs too large to manage - the fixpoint closure of recursive rules on large data may exceed storage and processing capabilities"

  - name: "TransE Simplistic Representation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:25-36)"
    quote: "TransE can be too simplistic; for example, in Figure 24, bus not only transforms San Pedro to Moon Valley, but also to Arica, Calama, and so forth"
    description: "TransE embedding model is too simplistic for relations with multiple targets or cyclical patterns - tends to give similar vectors to all target locations and assigns zero vectors to cyclical relations"

  - name: "Differentiable Rule Mining Path Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:8-10)"
    quote: "These differentiable rule mining techniques are, however, currently limited to learning path-like rules"
    description: "Neural/differentiable rule mining systems (NeuralLP, DRUM) can only learn path-like rules, not more complex patterns with branching or multiple body predicates"

  - name: "Embedding Out-of-Vocabulary Problem"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:660-665)"
    quote: "Such approaches also suffer from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where they are unable to provide results for edges involving previously unseen nodes..."
    description: "Knowledge graph embeddings cannot handle unseen nodes or edges - require retraining when new entities are added, unlike symbolic approaches that can apply learned rules to novel entities"

  - name: "Embedding Interpretability Deficit"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:650-658)"
    quote: "such models are often difficult to explain or understand... they will not provide an interpretable model to help understand why this is the case"
    description: "Knowledge graph embeddings lack interpretability - plausibility predictions are based on learned parameters that cannot be explained in human-understandable terms"

  - name: "Human Collaboration Error Sources"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:150-154)"
    quote: "the approach has a number of key drawbacks, due primarily to human error, disagreement, bias, vandalism, etc."
    description: "Human-collaborative knowledge graph creation suffers from errors, disagreements, biases, and vandalism - high costs and quality challenges from direct human contributions"

  - name: "Text Extraction Precision-Recall Trade-off"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:170-178)"
    quote: "extracting such information with high precision and recall for the purposes of creating or enriching a knowledge graph is a non-trivial challenge"
    description: "Text extraction for knowledge graphs involves difficult precision-recall trade-offs - NLP and IE techniques cannot perfectly extract all relevant information without errors"
