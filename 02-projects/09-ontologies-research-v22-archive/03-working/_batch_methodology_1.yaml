patterns:
  - name: "Model-Theoretic Semantics Approach"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:711-716)"
    quote: "Each axiom described by the previous tables, when added to a graph, enforces some condition(s) on the interpretations that satisfy the graph."
    description: "Top-down methodology for defining ontology semantics. The paper describes a formal, model-theoretic approach where interpretations are abstractly defined as domain graphs with mappings from data terms. This represents a theoretical, top-down approach to ontology definition where semantics are established through mathematical abstractions before application."

  - name: "Interpretation-Based Semantic Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:373-394)"
    quote: "we can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms..."
    description: "Top-down methodology for ontology construction. The approach defines interpretations abstractly using domain graphs and mappings, establishing formal semantics independent of specific data instances. This philosophical grounding precedes data-level implementation."

  - name: "OWL Feature-Based Ontology Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:350-357)"
    quote: "Amongst the most popular ontology languages used in practice are the Web Ontology Language (OWL), recommended by the W3C and compatible with RDF graphs"
    description: "Top-down standard-based methodology. OWL provides a standardized framework for ontology definition, reflecting a top-down approach where ontology features are pre-defined through W3C standards before application to specific domains."

  - name: "Materialisation Rule-Based Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:54-64)"
    quote: "Materialisation refers to the idea of applying rules recursively to a graph, adding the conclusions generated back to the graph until a fixpoint is reached"
    description: "Hybrid methodology combining top-down rule definition with bottom-up data processing. Rules are defined theoretically (top-down) but applied recursively to actual graph data (bottom-up) until a fixpoint is reached, producing inferred knowledge grounded in empirical data."

  - name: "Query Rewriting for Ontological Entailment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:92-109)"
    quote: "Another strategy is to use rules for query rewriting, which given a query, will automatically extend the query in order to find solutions entailed by a set of rules"
    description: "Top-down methodology where ontological definitions guide query transformation. The OWL 2 QL profile is specifically designed for this approach, where theoretical schema definitions determine how queries are rewritten to find entailed solutions."

  - name: "Description Logics Formalization"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:127-147)"
    quote: "Description Logics were initially introduced as a way to formalise the meaning of frames and semantic networks... DLs form a family of logics rather than a particular logic"
    description: "Top-down theoretical methodology for ontology formalization. DLs provide a formal logical foundation for knowledge graphs, derived from philosophical and mathematical frameworks (First Order Logic) rather than empirical observation. Different DLs balance expressive power and computational complexity."

  - name: "Inductive Knowledge Acquisition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:215-220)"
    quote: "inductively acquiring knowledge involves generalising patterns from a given set of input observations, which can then be used to generate novel but potentially imprecise predictions"
    description: "Bottom-up methodology for knowledge extraction. In contrast to deductive approaches, inductive methods derive patterns empirically from observed data (observations in graphs), generating knowledge through generalization rather than theoretical definition."

  - name: "Graph Analytics for Inductive Knowledge"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:343-359)"
    quote: "there is a rich body of work on graph analytics, which uses well-known functions/algorithms to detect communities or clusters, find central nodes and edges... embeddings can use self-supervision"
    description: "Bottom-up empirical methodology. Graph analytics applies analytical processes to extract patterns from large graph data using techniques like community detection, centrality measures, and embeddings. Knowledge emerges from data topology rather than theoretical definition."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Embeddings Self-Supervision"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:818-821)"
    quote: "The resulting embeddings can then be seen as models learnt through self-supervision that encode (latent) features of the graph, mapping input edges to output plausibility scores"
    description: "Bottom-up methodology where knowledge representation emerges from data. Embeddings learn latent features directly from graph structure without pre-defined theoretical frameworks, representing a purely empirical approach to encoding knowledge."

  - name: "Symbolic Learning for Rule Mining"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:667-675)"
    quote: "An alternative (sometimes complementary) approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that 'explain' a given set of positive and negative edges"
    description: "Hybrid methodology combining bottom-up pattern discovery with top-down symbolic representation. Rules are learned from empirical data (bottom-up) but expressed in logical/symbolic language (top-down), enabling interpretable models for deductive reasoning."

  - name: "AMIE Top-Down Rule Refinement"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:780-813)"
    quote: "AMIE... builds rules in a top-down fashion starting with rule heads like => ?x country ?y. For each rule head of this form, three types of refinements are considered"
    description: "Hybrid methodology with top-down structure. AMIE starts with abstract rule patterns (top-down) but validates and refines them using support and confidence measures computed from empirical data (bottom-up). The methodology combines theoretical rule structure with data-driven validation."

  - name: "Ontology Engineering Methodologies"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:765-778)"
    quote: "Ontology engineering refers to the development and application of methodologies for building ontologies... Early methodologies were often based on a waterfall-like process"
    description: "Top-down methodology for ontology construction. Early approaches followed waterfall processes where requirements and conceptualization were fixed before implementation. Later agile methodologies (DILIGENT, XD, MOM, SAMOD) introduced iterative refinement while maintaining top-down conceptual design."

  - name: "Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:828-847)"
    quote: "Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) are another common feature of modern methodologies, specifying generalisable ontology modelling patterns that can be used as inspiration"
    description: "Top-down methodology using reusable templates. ODPs provide pre-defined modeling patterns based on best practices, representing a top-down approach where theoretical patterns guide ontology construction. Patterns can be used as inspiration, templates, or directly reusable components."

  - name: "Ontology Learning from Text"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:849-886)"
    quote: "Ontology learning, in contrast, can be used to (semi-)automatically extract information from text that is useful for the ontology engineering process"
    description: "Bottom-up methodology for semi-automatic ontology extraction. Ontology learning extracts terminology and axioms from text using measures of unithood, termhood, and Hearst patterns. This empirical approach derives ontological structures from natural language corpora rather than theoretical design."
