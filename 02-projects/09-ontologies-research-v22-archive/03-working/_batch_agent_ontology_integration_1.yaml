patterns:
  - name: "Knowledge Graph as Semantic Integration Layer"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:67-75)"
    quote: "Employing a graph-based abstraction of knowledge has numerous benefits...edges capture the (potentially cyclical) relations between the entities"
    description: "Knowledge graphs serve as a semantic integration layer enabling AI agents to exploit diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. The graph structure allows agents to traverse relationships between entities, supporting reasoning about connections that would be difficult in relational or NoSQL models. This provides the foundational substrate for agent-ontology interaction."

  - name: "Ontology-Enhanced Query Navigation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:88-96)"
    quote: "specialised graph query languages support not only standard relational operators...but also navigational operators for recursively finding entities connected through arbitrary-length paths"
    description: "Graph query languages provide navigational operators that enable AI agents to discover entities through path expressions. This recursive path-finding capability allows agents to explore ontological structures without predefined query boundaries, supporting exploratory reasoning and knowledge discovery."

  - name: "Ontology-Guided Semantic Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:94-98)"
    quote: "Standard knowledge representation formalisms - such as ontologies and rules - can be employed to define and reason about the semantics of the terms used to label and describe the nodes and edges"
    description: "Ontologies provide semantic grounding for knowledge graph terms, enabling AI agents to reason about the meaning of relationships. This allows agents to understand not just the structure but the semantics of data, supporting more sophisticated inference and decision-making."

  - name: "Machine Learning Over Graph Structures"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:99-104)"
    quote: "Scalable frameworks for graph analytics can be leveraged for computing centrality, clustering, summarisation...Various representations have also been developed that support applying machine learning techniques directly over graphs"
    description: "Knowledge graphs support machine learning techniques that operate directly on graph structures. This enables AI agents to learn patterns from ontological knowledge, combining symbolic reasoning with statistical learning for hybrid AI approaches."

  - name: "Deductive Entailment for Agent Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:213-227)"
    quote: "As humans, we can deduce more from the data graph than what the edges explicitly indicate...given the data as premises, and some general rules about the world...we can use a deductive process to derive new data"
    description: "Ontologies enable deductive reasoning where AI agents can derive new knowledge from explicit data combined with general rules. This allows agents to reason beyond explicitly stated facts, supporting commonsense and domain-specific inference that enriches their understanding."

  - name: "Materialisation for Pre-computed Inference"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:54-64)"
    quote: "Materialisation refers to the idea of applying rules recursively to a graph, adding the conclusions generated back to the graph until a fixpoint is reached and nothing more can be added"
    description: "Materialisation pre-computes all possible inferences from ontological rules, creating an enriched knowledge graph that agents can query directly. This trade-off between storage and query time allows agents to access deduced knowledge without runtime inference costs."

  - name: "Query Rewriting for Ontology-Aware Retrieval"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:92-109)"
    quote: "Another strategy is to use rules for query rewriting, which given a query, will automatically extend the query in order to find solutions entailed by a set of rules"
    description: "Query rewriting automatically expands agent queries to include ontologically entailed results. This allows agents to issue simple queries while the system handles ontological expansion, returning results that account for class hierarchies, property relationships, and other semantic knowledge."

  - name: "Graph Analytics with Entailment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:728-764)"
    quote: "Applying analytics with or without such entailments - e.g., before or after materialisation - may yield radically different results...it may be of interest to explore semantically-invariant analytics"
    description: "Analytics can be combined with ontological entailment to analyze the semantic content rather than just topological features. This enables agents to perform analytics that account for equivalent representations (e.g., inverse properties), ensuring consistent results across semantically equivalent graphs."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Plausibility Scoring"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:795-822)"
    quote: "knowledge graph embeddings can use self-supervision to learn a low-dimensional numeric model of a knowledge graph that maps input edges to an output plausibility score indicating the likelihood of the edge being true"
    description: "Knowledge graph embeddings provide AI agents with plausibility scores for potential facts, enabling probabilistic reasoning over ontological knowledge. Agents can use these scores to assess confidence in predicted relationships, supporting uncertain reasoning and knowledge completion."

  - name: "Embeddings for Link Prediction and Completion"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:824-836)"
    quote: "the plausibility scoring function can be used to complete edges with missing nodes/edge labels for the purposes of link prediction...we might intuitively expect Torres del Paine to be a plausible candidate"
    description: "Embeddings enable agents to predict missing links in knowledge graphs by scoring plausibility of potential edges. This supports agents in completing incomplete knowledge, discovering implicit relationships, and making inferences where explicit knowledge is lacking."

  - name: "Entailment-Aware Embedding Models"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-390)"
    quote: "deductive knowledge could be used to improve the embeddings...KALE computes entity and relation embeddings using a translational model that is adapted to further consider rules using t-norm fuzzy logics"
    description: "Embedding models can incorporate ontological rules to improve learned representations. Systems like KALE and RUGE jointly optimize embeddings with logical rules, allowing agents to benefit from both statistical patterns and deductive constraints. This bridges symbolic and sub-symbolic AI."

  - name: "Graph Neural Networks for Node Classification"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:427-445)"
    quote: "A graph neural network builds a neural network based on the topology of the data graph...Typically a model is then learnt to map input features for nodes to output features in a supervised manner"
    description: "Graph neural networks enable agents to learn from knowledge graph topology for classification tasks. Unlike embeddings, GNNs support end-to-end supervised learning, allowing agents to classify entities, predict properties, or make decisions based on graph-learned features."

  - name: "Symbolic Learning for Interpretable Models"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:667-689)"
    quote: "adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that 'explain' a given set of positive and negative edges. These hypotheses then serve as interpretable models that can be used for further deductive reasoning"
    description: "Symbolic learning extracts interpretable logical rules from knowledge graphs. Unlike neural approaches, these rules can be verified by domain experts and applied to unseen examples. This provides agents with explainable models for their predictions, addressing the black-box problem of neural approaches."

  - name: "Rule Mining for Knowledge Discovery"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:704-752)"
    quote: "Rule mining, in the general sense, refers to discovering meaningful patterns in the form of rules from large collections of background knowledge...The goal of rule mining is to identify new rules that entail a high ratio of positive edges"
    description: "Rule mining discovers logical patterns from knowledge graphs that agents can use for reasoning. Systems like AMIE extract rules with support and confidence measures, enabling agents to learn domain knowledge automatically and apply it for prediction and explanation."

  - name: "PROV-AGENT for Agentic Provenance"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:30-38)"
    quote: "we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance"
    description: "PROV-AGENT provides an ontological model specifically designed for tracking AI agent interactions within workflows. By extending W3C PROV with MCP concepts, it enables provenance queries that trace agent decisions, prompts, and responses through their impact on downstream data and tasks."

  - name: "Agent as First-Class Ontological Entity"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:199-204)"
    quote: "the W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process), with agents representing either software or human actors"
    description: "In PROV-based ontologies, Agent is a core class alongside Entity and Activity. This foundational triad (Agent-Activity-Entity) provides the ontological grounding for modeling AI agents as responsible actors within workflows, enabling attribution and accountability for agent actions."

  - name: "AIAgent as Ontological Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-284)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow provenance graph"
    description: "The PROV-AGENT model creates AIAgent as a specialization of PROV Agent, allowing AI-specific concepts (tools, prompts, model invocations) to integrate with standard workflow provenance. This ontological design enables unified querying across agent and non-agent activities."

  - name: "Provenance-Based Agent Accountability"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:487-538)"
    quote: "With PROV-AGENT, several new queries are enabled to support agent accountability and tracing back when errors/hallucinations happen...Q1. Given an agent decision, what was the complete lineage until the first input data?"
    description: "The ontological structure enables provenance queries that trace agent decisions back through their complete reasoning chain. This supports root cause analysis when agents produce errors or hallucinations, allowing debugging through the prompt-response-decision chain connected to input data and downstream effects."
