patterns:
  - name: "Knowledge Graph as Data Graph Plus Enhancements"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:72-87)"
    quote: "We refer to a knowledge graph as a data graph potentially enhanced with representations of schema, identity, context, ontologies and/or rules"
    description: "The paper defines a hierarchy of abstraction where a data graph is the base level (collection of data represented as nodes and edges), and a knowledge graph represents a higher abstraction level that adds schema, identity, context, ontologies and rules. This establishes a clear foundational-to-application abstraction pattern: data graph (foundational) -> knowledge graph (enhanced/application level)."

  - name: "Three Types of Graph Schemata Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:89-98)"
    quote: "We discuss three types of graph schemata: semantic, validating, and emergent"
    description: "The paper identifies three distinct schema abstraction levels: (1) Semantic schema - defines meaning of high-level terms/vocabulary for reasoning; (2) Validating schema - prescribes structure and constraints for validation; (3) Emergent schema - automatically extracted latent structures. This represents abstraction from conceptual (semantic) to structural (validating) to empirical (emergent)."

  - name: "Semantic Schema for Vocabulary Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:100-118)"
    quote: "A semantic schema allows for defining the meaning of high-level terms (aka vocabulary or terminology) used in the graph, which facilitates reasoning"
    description: "Semantic schema operates at a high abstraction level focused on defining classes (Event, City), class hierarchies (Food Festival subclass of Festival), and property semantics (subproperties, domains, ranges). This is a core/domain abstraction level that sits between foundational ontologies and application-specific data."

  - name: "RDFS as Core Domain Schema Standard"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:176-191)"
    quote: "A prominent standard for defining a semantic schema for (RDF) graphs is the RDF Schema (RDFS) standard, which allows for defining subclasses, subproperties, domains, and ranges"
    description: "RDFS is positioned as a core/domain level ontology standard for RDF graphs, enabling the definition of class hierarchies and property characteristics. OWL extends this further with more expressive semantics, representing a progression from domain to application-level ontology features."

  - name: "Open vs Closed World Assumption Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:192-222)"
    quote: "Semantic schema are typically defined for incomplete graph data, where the absence of an edge between two nodes... does not mean that the relation does not hold"
    description: "The paper distinguishes abstraction levels based on completeness assumptions: Open World Assumption (OWA) for incomplete data at higher abstraction levels vs Closed World Assumption (CWA) for complete data at lower/application levels. Local Closed World Assumption (LCWA) provides a middle-ground abstraction where portions are assumed complete."

  - name: "Validating Schema with Shapes"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:230-265)"
    quote: "A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes"
    description: "Validating schemas using shapes (ShEx, SHACL) operate at an application abstraction level, defining concrete constraints for data validation. This contrasts with semantic schemas that operate at a more abstract/conceptual level for reasoning. Shapes represent a more operational, constraint-focused abstraction."

  - name: "Quotient Graphs as Emergent Schema Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:434-492)"
    quote: "A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient graphs, which partition groups of nodes... according to some equivalence relation"
    description: "Quotient graphs provide an empirical/bottom-up abstraction mechanism that automatically summarizes data graphs into higher-level structures. This represents an emergent abstraction level derived from data rather than prescribed top-down. Bisimilarity preserves forward-directed paths, connecting abstraction to structural properties."

  - name: "Ontology as Formal Convention at Domain Level"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:286-339)"
    quote: "In the context of computing, an ontology is then a concrete, formal representation of what terms mean within the scope in which they are used (e.g., a given domain)"
    description: "Ontologies are positioned at the domain abstraction level, providing formal conventions for term meanings. Different ontologies can capture different perspectives at the same abstraction level (e.g., one event ontology allowing multiple venues vs another requiring single venue). OWL/OBOF are the ontology languages operating at this level."

  - name: "Interpretation as Abstraction Bridge"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:361-394)"
    quote: "We can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms of the data graph to those of the domain graph"
    description: "The paper defines interpretations as a bridge between syntactic (data graph) and semantic (domain graph) abstraction levels. Entities and relations in the domain graph represent real-world phenomena, while nodes and edges in the data graph represent their syntactic encodings. This is a key foundational-to-application abstraction mechanism."

  - name: "UNA/NUNA and OWA/CWA Assumption Levels"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:405-451)"
    quote: "In the case of OWL, the NUNA and OWA are adopted, thus representing the most general case, whereby multiple nodes/edge-labels in the graph may refer to the same entity/relation-type"
    description: "OWL's adoption of No Unique Name Assumption (NUNA) and Open World Assumption (OWA) positions it at a higher foundational abstraction level that makes fewer assumptions. Closed World Assumption and Unique Name Assumption represent more constrained, application-level abstractions that make stronger assumptions about data completeness and identity."

  - name: "Description Logics as Foundational Formalism"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:127-189)"
    quote: "Description Logics (DLs) were initially introduced as a way to formalise the meaning of frames and semantic networks... DLs form a family of logics rather than a particular logic"
    description: "Description Logics are positioned as foundational formalisms that heavily influenced OWL. DLs provide the theoretical basis for decidable reasoning, with different DLs striking different balances between expressive power and computational complexity. OWL 2 DL is a fragment restricted for decidability, representing a constrained application-level subset of the foundational DL abstraction."

  - name: "Four Categories of Knowledge Graph Definitions by Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:127-254)"
    quote: "Category I: simply defines the knowledge graph as a graph where nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships... Category II: a knowledge graph is a graph-structured knowledge base... Category III: outline additional, technical characteristics... Category IV: adopts an extensional definition"
    description: "The paper identifies four categories of knowledge graph definitions representing different abstraction approaches: Category I (minimal/foundational - just nodes and edges), Category II (intermediate - graph-structured knowledge base), Category III (detailed technical criteria including reasoning), Category IV (extensional/by example). This taxonomy itself represents varying abstraction levels in defining knowledge graphs."
