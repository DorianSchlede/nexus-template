  # === CHUNK 1 PATTERNS ===

  - name: "Node-Edge-Node Triple Structure"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-142)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities"
    description: "The fundamental entity relationship pattern in knowledge graphs: nodes represent entities, edges represent relations. This establishes the basic structural relationship where entities are connected via typed edges expressing semantic relationships."

  - name: "Directed Edge-Labelled Graph Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:404-408)"
    quote: "A directed edge-labelled graph (also known as a multi-relational graph) is defined as a set of nodes and a set of directed labelled edges between those nodes, like [Santa Lucia] city Santiago"
    description: "Entity relationships are modeled as directed, labeled edges connecting source and target nodes. The edge label specifies the relationship type (e.g., 'city'), enabling multi-relational semantics."

  - name: "Binary Relation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:395-399)"
    quote: "By instead adopting a graph data model from the outset, the board could forgo the need for an upfront schema, and could define any (binary) relation between any pair of entities at any time"
    description: "Entity relationships are fundamentally binary - connecting exactly two entities. This binary relation pattern allows flexible, schema-free definition of relationships between entity pairs."

  - name: "Heterogeneous Graph Entity-Type Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:483-490)"
    quote: "A heterogeneous graph (or heterogeneous information network) is a graph where each node and edge is assigned one type. Heterogeneous graphs are thus akin to del graphs with edge labels corresponding to edge types"
    description: "Entities and their relationships can be typed, enabling partitioning of nodes by entity type. Edges can be homogeneous (between same-type nodes) or heterogeneous (between different-type nodes)."

  - name: "Property Graph Edge Attributes"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:548-552)"
    quote: "The property graph model was thus proposed to offer additional flexibility when modelling data as a graph. A property graph allows a set of property-value pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges"
    description: "Entity relationships can carry additional attribute metadata as property-value pairs. This extends the basic edge with contextual information about the relationship itself."

  - name: "Named Graph Dataset Structure"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:583-609)"
    quote: "A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph. Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph... nodes and edges can be repeated across graphs, where the same node in different graphs will typically refer to the same entity"
    description: "Multiple sub-graphs can share entities across named graph boundaries. Same nodes in different graphs reference the same real-world entity, enabling entity integration when merging graphs."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:107-118)"
    quote: "We may subsequently observe some natural relations between some of these classes that we would like to capture... we present a class hierarchy for events where children are defined to be subclasses of their parents"
    description: "Hierarchical classification relationship where child classes inherit from parent classes. If entity is type Food Festival, it implies entity is also type Festival and type Event through subclass inference."

  - name: "Subproperty Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:120-125)"
    quote: "we may consider that the properties city and venue are sub-properties of a more general property location, such that given an edge [Santa Lucia] city Santiago, we may also infer that [Santa Lucia] location Santiago"
    description: "Property hierarchy where specific properties imply more general ones. Subproperty relationships enable inference of broader relationship types from specific edge labels."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:250-277)"
    quote: "A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes. The shape's target can be defined in many ways... Constraints can then be defined on the targetted nodes, such as to restrict the number or types of values taken on a given property"
    description: "Entity relationships can be validated via shape constraints that specify cardinality, type requirements, and structural patterns. Shapes define expected relationship patterns for entity types."

  - name: "Quotient Graph Structural Equivalence"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:439-457)"
    quote: "quotient graphs partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some equivalence relation while preserving some structural properties of the graph... the nodes of this quotient graph are the partitions of nodes from the data graph"
    description: "Entity relationships can be abstracted via quotient graphs that group structurally equivalent entities. Preserves edge connectivity patterns between entity partitions."

  - name: "Persistent Identifier Entity References"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:551-567)"
    quote: "To avoid such clashes, long-lasting persistent identifiers (PIDs) can be created in order to uniquely identify an entity. Prominent examples of PID schemes include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for papers, ORCID iDs for authors"
    description: "Entity relationships require unique, persistent identifiers to avoid naming clashes during graph merging. PIDs ensure entities maintain consistent identity across knowledge graph boundaries."

  - name: "Same-As Identity Link"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:686-698)"
    quote: "A second option is to use identity links to state that a local entity has the same identity as another coreferent entity found in an external source; an instantiation of this concept can be found in the OWL standard, which defines the owl:sameAs property relating coreferent entities"
    description: "Explicit relationship declaring two entity nodes refer to the same real-world entity. Enables entity consolidation across knowledge graphs and data integration."

  - name: "Temporal Context on Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:8-21)"

    description: "Entity relationships can be annotated with temporal validity periods. Context constrains when a relationship holds true, enabling temporal reasoning over edges."

  - name: "Annotated Relationship with Meet/Join Operators"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:107-127)"
    quote: "Annotated RDF allows for representing various forms of context modelled as semi-rings: algebraic structures consisting of domain values (e.g., temporal intervals, fuzzy values, etc.) and two main operators to combine domain values: meet and join"
    description: "Entity relationships can carry algebraic annotations supporting intersection (meet) and union (join) operations. Enables querying relationships with automatic context intersection/combination."
