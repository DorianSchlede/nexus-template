      FIRST: Read 00-system/.cache/session_start_context.xml

      You are testing the plan-project skill's type detection.

      TASK:
      1. Read the plan-project SKILL.md at 00-system/skills/projects/plan-project/SKILL.md
      2. Read the type detection logic and templates
      3. Check if _type.yaml files exist for all 8 types
      4. Verify each type has proper description for semantic matching

      REPORT:
      - List all project types found
      - Confirm each has _type.yaml with description
      - Note any missing or incomplete types
      - Verify the router workflow sequence is documented
    pass_criteria:
      - "Found 8 project types"
      - "All types have _type.yaml"
      - "All types have description field"
      - "Router workflow documented"

    description: "Validate init_project.py script works correctly"
    prompt: |
      FIRST: Read 00-system/.cache/session_start_context.xml

      You are testing the init_project.py script.

      TASK:
      1. Read the script at 00-system/skills/projects/plan-project/scripts/init_project.py
      2. Verify it accepts --type parameter
      3. Check it creates proper folder structure
      4. Verify it handles all 8 project types

      REPORT:
      - Does script exist?
      - Does it accept --type parameter?
      - What folder structure does it create?
      - Any errors or issues found?
    pass_criteria:
      - "Script exists"
      - "Accepts --type parameter"
      - "Creates 4 directories (01-planning, 02-resources, 03-working, 04-outputs)"
      - "Handles multiple project types"
