## Last Session Summary

**What was done**:
- Phase 1 COMPLETE: Planning finished, stakeholder reviewed
- Reviewed Project 27 spawned project specs (score-config-setup, session-scorer, weekly-analysis, ground-truth-bootstrap)

**Key findings**:
- Validated 10/10 subagents can read `00-system/.cache/session_start_context.xml`
- Langfuse running (version 3.143.0)
- Project 27 research provides session scorer architecture
- Project 34 is different from P27 spawns - focuses on pre-deployment validation, not post-session quality scoring

**Next steps**:
1. Phase 2: Validate Langfuse trace capture for subagents
2. Phase 3: Create validate-feature skill skeleton
3. Phase 4: Test Runner implementation

**Blockers**:
- Need to validate agent_id → Langfuse session_id mapping
- Need Langfuse env vars configured to query traces
