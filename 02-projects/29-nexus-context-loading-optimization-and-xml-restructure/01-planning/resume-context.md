## Quick Resume Context

**Status**: COMPLETE - Remaining tasks moved to Project 31

**Achieved**:
- 60.9% token reduction (target was 30%)
- All 6 MECE state templates implemented
- CLI discovery pattern implemented (functions ready, CLI wiring in Project 31)
- 7 philosophy principles added to orchestrator
- System-first routing priority
- Feature branch merged to main

**Moved to Project 31**:
- CLI flag implementation (--discover, --list-categories)
- Documentation updates (orchestrator.md, system-map.md CLI hints)
- Performance verification (read existing logs)
- Project 29 archival

**Key Deliverables**:
- loaders.py: discover_skills_in_category() at L1375-1478
- loaders.py: list_integration_categories() at L1480-1518
- session_start.py: Performance timing at L858-862
- 6 startup state templates in .claude/hooks/templates/

*Project 31 will complete remaining work and archive this project*
