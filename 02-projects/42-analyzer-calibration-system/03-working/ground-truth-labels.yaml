# Ground Truth Labels for Analyzer Calibration
# Date: 2026-01-07
# Purpose: Establish known PASS/FAIL outcomes for test-case-analyzer calibration

# Calibration Criteria (used across all traces)
# These criteria are ASSERTABLE - should have one correct answer per trace

# Gap Analysis
gaps:
  - issue: "No clear FAIL cases"
    mitigation: "May need to create synthetic FAIL scenarios"
  - issue: "Some criteria marked UNCERTAIN"
    mitigation: "UNCERTAIN handling will test analyzer consistency on ambiguous cases"
  - issue: "Criteria may be too broad"
    mitigation: "Will narrow criteria in tuning phase if variance found"
