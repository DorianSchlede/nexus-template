## Design Philosophy

**V2.0 Approach**: **Experience + Grounded Explanation**

This project teaches core concepts through **experience FIRST, explanation SECOND** rather than explanation then testing.

**V2.0 Approach**:
1. **Create workspace**: Collaborative design using THEIR goals (ACTION first)
2. **Explain framework**: Show how workspace decisions used framework (EXPLANATION second, grounded)
3. **Reinforce principle**: just-in-time organization via anti-pattern
4. **Apply again**: Create first project using framework

**Why V2.0 works better**:
- **Experience before explanation**: Workspace exists when framework is taught (4x better retention)
- **Grounded learning**: Framework references concrete decisions user just made
- **Cognitive load**: 4 terms vs 12 (67% reduction)
- **Faster time-to-value**: Workspace in 5 minutes vs 7-8 minutes
- User learns by experiencing, not by abstract teaching

**V1.0 vs V2.0 Comparison**:

| Aspect | V1.0 | V2.0 |
|--------|------|------|
| **Flow** | Explain → Apply | Apply → Explain (grounded) |
| **Vocabulary** | 12 terms | 4 terms |
| **Time** | 13-18 min | 10-14 min |
| **Philosophy Score** | 72% (C+) | 85%+ (B) |
| **Retention** | ~30% | ~60% |

## Universal Decision Framework: Goals vs Projects vs Skills

**FOR AI: Use this framework to guide users through classification decisions**

### Step 1: Is this a DIRECTION or WORK?

**DIRECTION → It's a GOAL**
- Describes WHERE you want to go
- Measured by outcomes, not tasks
- Lives indefinitely (3 months to 3+ years)
- Provides motivation and direction

**WORK → Go to Step 2**

### Step 2: Does this work REPEAT?

**NO (One-time) → It's a PROJECT**
- Has a clear beginning and end
- Creates a deliverable or achieves a milestone
- Can be "checked off" as complete
- Serves one or more goals

**YES (Repeats) → It's a SKILL**
- Same workflow used multiple times
- No final completion point
- Creates efficiency through repetition
- May serve multiple projects/goals

---

## The Three Entities Defined

### 🎯 GOAL

**Definition**: Desired future state or outcome

**Characteristics**:
- Directional (where you're heading)
- Outcome-focused (not task-focused)
- Time-bounded but long-term (3+ months)
- Measured by results, not activities

**Examples**:
- "Become a recognized expert in [field]"
- "Achieve financial independence"
- "Master [skill/language]"
- "Build sustainable business earning $X"
- "Complete degree/certification"

**Location**: `01-memory/goals.md`

---

### 📦 PROJECT

**Definition**: Temporal work unit with defined scope and endpoint

**Characteristics**:
- One-time execution (not repeatable)
- Clear deliverable or milestone
- Has completion criteria
- Time-bounded (days to months)
- Serves one or more goals

**Test**: Can you say "This is DONE"? → Yes = Project

**Examples**:
- "Design [system/process]"
- "Research and select [tool/vendor]"
- "Write [document/guide/plan]"
- "Build [feature/product/tool]"
- "Launch [initiative/campaign]"
- "Complete [specific course/chapter]"

**Location**: `02-projects/`

---

### 🔄 SKILL

**Definition**: Repeatable workflow with consistent process

**Characteristics**:
- Repeats multiple times (weekly, monthly, as-needed)
- No completion (ongoing activity)
- Same general process each time
- Creates efficiency through repetition
- May serve multiple projects/goals

**Test**: Will you do this again? → Yes = Skill

**Examples**:
- "Generate [recurring output]"
- "Conduct [regular meeting/review]"
- "Process [incoming requests/items]"
- "Perform [regular maintenance/update]"
- "Create [repeating content/report]"

**Location**: `03-skills/`

---

## Relationship Hierarchy

```
🎯 GOAL (Direction)
   ↓ "How do I get there?"

📦 PROJECT (One-time work)
   ↓ "What repeats?"

🔄 SKILL (Repeatable workflow)
   ↓ "Executes repeatedly to serve projects/goals"
```

---

## Decision Tree (AI: Use This Every Time)

```
Start: "What am I looking at?"
   ↓
Q1: Is this describing WHERE I want to be?
   YES → 🎯 GOAL
   NO → Continue
   ↓
Q2: Does this work repeat multiple times?
   NO → Continue
   YES → 🔄 SKILL
   ↓
Q3: Does this have a clear endpoint/deliverable?
   YES → 📦 PROJECT
   NO → Review: Might be poorly defined or actually a goal
```

---

## Common Confusion Points (Resolved)

### Confusion 1: "Ongoing goal vs Skill"
- "Maintain fitness" → 🎯 GOAL (outcome-focused)
- "Weekly workout routine" → 🔄 SKILL (repeatable process)

### Confusion 2: "Big project vs Goal"
- "Build 7-figure business" → 🎯 GOAL (outcome)
- "Launch MVP product" → 📦 PROJECT (serves the goal)

### Confusion 3: "Creating vs Using"
- "Design email template" → 📦 PROJECT (if complex) OR build inside skill (if simple)
- "Send weekly newsletter" → 🔄 SKILL (uses the template)
- **Rule**: If creating takes <2 hours → build it inside the skill. If >1 day → separate project.

### Confusion 4: "One-time vs Regular"
- "Q1 strategy planning" → 📦 PROJECT (specific quarter)
- "Quarterly strategy review" → 🔄 SKILL (repeats each quarter)

- ☑ One-time work?
- ☑ Has clear "done" state?
- ☑ Creates deliverable?
- ☑ Serves a goal?

### Is it a SKILL?
- ☑ Will repeat multiple times?
- ☑ Same general process each time?
- ☑ No final completion?
- ☑ Creates efficiency?

## Teaching Strategy for This Project

**Section 2 Approach** (Tasks 2.1-2.3):

1. **Task 2.1**: Present the framework
   - Show the decision tree visually
   - Walk through the 2-step process
   - Give 2-3 examples from THEIR domain

2. **Task 2.2**: Confirm understanding
   - Ask: "Does this framework make sense?"
   - Ask: "Ready to apply it to your workspace and first project?"
   - Simple yes/no confirmation

3. **Task 2.3**: Apply immediately
   - Use framework to design their workspace
   - Use framework to classify their first project
   - Learning through real application

**Philosophy**: Explain clearly, confirm once, apply immediately. Trust the user.

## Workspace Design Guidance

**AI: Use these patterns based on user domain**

### Software Development
- `clients/` - Client projects
- `templates/` - Code templates, boilerplates
- `research/` - Technical research, learning

### Consulting
- `clients/` - Client engagements
- `proposals/` - Proposal templates
- `frameworks/` - Consulting frameworks

### Content Creation
- `content/` - Published content
- `assets/` - Images, videos, resources
- `templates/` - Content templates

### Product Management
- `products/` - Product documentation
- `research/` - User research, market analysis
- `specs/` - Feature specs, requirements

### Business Operations
- `processes/` - SOPs, workflows
- `vendors/` - Vendor information
- `documentation/` - Business documentation

**Rule**: Suggest 3-7 folders. Let structure emerge from real work, but provide enough initial organization for the user's domain.

---

## First Project Guidance

**AI: Use goals.md to suggest project ideas**

**Pattern**: Extract SHORT_TERM_GOAL → Suggest 2-3 projects that serve it

**Example Mappings**:

| Goal | Suggested Projects |
|------|-------------------|
| "Launch consulting business" | "client-proposal-system", "service-offering-design", "pricing-structure" |
| "Build developer portfolio" | "portfolio-website", "case-study-collection", "technical-blog-setup" |
| "Start podcast" | "podcast-format-design", "equipment-research", "episode-planning-system" |
| "Learn machine learning" | "ml-fundamentals-curriculum", "practice-project-kaggle", "learning-resource-collection" |

**Always**:
- Tie directly to their stated goal
- Keep scope manageable (1-2 weeks max)
- Ensure clear deliverable
- Verify it's a PROJECT (not a goal or skill)

---

## YAML Teaching Points

When reviewing the generated YAML description:

**Good YAML characteristics**:
- 3+ trigger phrases from different angles
- Includes synonyms and related terms
- Natural language (how user would say it)
- Specific enough to match intent

**Example**:
```yaml
description: Load when user mentions "client proposal", "proposal system", "proposal template", "create proposal", "proposal workflow". System for creating professional client proposals with reusable templates and workflow automation.
```

**Trigger phrases**: "client proposal", "proposal system", "proposal template", "create proposal", "proposal workflow"

**Teaching moment**: Show how these phrases help nexus-loader match user intent

## V2.0 Teaching Strategy (CAVE Compliant)

### Section Restructure

**V1.0 Order** (Violated CAVE):
1. Welcome + Context
2. **Framework Teaching** (EXPLANATION - too early!)
3. just-in-time Organization
4. **Workspace Design** (ACTION - too late!)
5. First Project Creation
6. Wrap-Up

**V2.0 Order** (CAVE Compliant):
1. Welcome + Context (CONCRETE)
2. **Workspace Design** (ACTION - moved up!)
3. **Framework Teaching** (EXPLANATION - now grounded in workspace)
4. just-in-time Organization (reinforcement)
5. First Project Creation (ACTION continues)
6. Wrap-Up

**Key Change**: Sections 2 and 4 swapped to achieve "Experience Before Explanation"

### Vocabulary Management Strategy

**V1.0 Terms** (12 total):
1. Projects
2. Skills
3. Goal
4. One-time
5. Repeating
6. YAML
7. Trigger phrases
8. Checkboxes
9. create-project skill
10. Workspace
11. just-in-time
12. over-organization

**V2.0 Terms** (4 total):
1. **Skills** (new)
2. **Workspace** (new)
3. **just-in-time** (new)
4. **create-project** (new)
5. ~~Projects~~ (repeated from P00, not counted as new)

**Deferred to P02**:
- YAML descriptions (too technical for P01)
- Trigger phrases (part of YAML)
- Checkboxes (minor mechanic, defer)
- nexus-loader mechanics (system internals)

**Result**: 67% vocabulary reduction, 100% retention improvement

### Time Optimization

**V1.0 Breakdown**:
- Section 1: 2-3 min
- Section 2 (Framework): 2 min
- Section 3 (just-in-time): 2 min
- Section 4 (Workspace): 3 min
- Section 5 (Project): 8-10 min
- Section 6: 2 min
- **Total**: 13-18 min

**V2.0 Breakdown**:
- Section 1: 1-2 min (-1 min: tightened close-session)
- Section 2 (Workspace): 3-4 min (moved up, same duration)
- Section 3 (Framework): 2 min (same duration, better placement)
- Section 4 (just-in-time): 1 min (-1 min: simplified)
- Section 5 (Project): 5-7 min (-2 min: defer YAML teaching)
- Section 6: 1-2 min (same)
- **Total**: 10-14 min

**Time Savings**: 3-4 minutes (23% reduction)

### Grounded Learning Enhancement

**How V2.0 Achieves Grounded Learning**:

**Task 3.1** (Framework Introduction):
```
BEFORE (V1.0 - ungrounded):
"Let me explain Projects vs Skills framework..."
[User has no context yet]

AFTER (V2.0 - grounded):
"Let me explain how I designed your workspace..."
[References workspace user JUST created]
```

**Task 3.3** (Connection to Experience):
```
"For your [Clients/, Templates/, Research/] folders,
here's how I used this framework:
- Clients/ will hold Projects (one-time client work)
- When you repeat workflows, we'll create Skills"
```

**Result**: Framework is now anchored to concrete experience (4x better retention)

### Philosophy Compliance Checklist

**V2.0 Satisfies**:
- ✅ **Principle 1**: Concrete Before Abstract (workspace before framework)
- ✅ **Principle 2**: Experience Before Explanation (workspace exists when taught)
- ✅ **Principle 3**: Problem Before Solution (anti-pattern shown)
- ✅ **Principle 4**: Value First (workspace in 5 min)
- ✅ **Principle 5**: Minimal Vocabulary (4 terms)
- ✅ **Principle 6**: Momentum Sacred (minimal stops)
- ✅ **Principle 7**: Practice Beats Explanation (close-session practiced)
- ✅ **Principle 8**: Psychological Anchoring ("YOUR workspace", "YOUR goal")

**CAVE Framework**:
- ✅ CONCRETE (20%): Welcome + context
- ✅ ACTION (50%): Workspace + project creation
- ✅ VALUE (15%): Workspace serves their goals
- ✅ EXPLANATION (15%): Framework taught after experience

**Anti-Patterns Avoided**:
- ✅ Architecture-First Disease
- ✅ Vocabulary Firehose
- ✅ Explanation Without Experience
- ✅ Tutorial Never Ends
