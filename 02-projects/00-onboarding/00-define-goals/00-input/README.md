# Input Folder - Optional Context Documents

**Purpose**: This folder is for YOU to add documents that help the AI understand your work context before onboarding begins.

## What to Put Here (Optional)

Add any documents that describe your work, goals, or current situation:

- **Business plans** (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- **Project notes** or work documents
- **Strategy documents** or roadmaps
- **Company/product descriptions**
- **Current goals or OKRs**
- **Any context about your work**

## How It Works

1. **Before starting onboarding**: Add your documents to this folder
2. **During Section 2 of onboarding**: AI will check this folder
3. **If files exist**: AI asks permission to read them
4. **After reading**: AI uses this context for better suggestions throughout onboarding

## Benefits

**Better AI Suggestions**:
- Questions reference YOUR actual work (not generic)
- Goal suggestions align with YOUR context
- Metrics/milestones suggestions are more relevant
- Examples feel personalized to YOUR domain

**Example**:
- You add "business-plan.pdf" describing a consulting business
- AI reads: "consulting business, target: solopreneurs, goal: first 5 clients in 3 months"
- During discovery: "Based on your business plan, you're launching a consulting business for solopreneurs. Tell me more..."
- During goal-setting: "A possible 3-month goal: 'Sign 5 consulting clients'. Does this fit?"

## Supported File Types

- **Text**: .txt, .md
- **Documents**: .pdf, .docx
- **Data**: .json, .yaml, .csv

## Privacy

- Files are read ONLY during this onboarding session
- Content is used ONLY for suggestions during onboarding
- Nothing is shared outside your local system

**Note**: This folder is completely optional! If you prefer to start fresh, just leave it empty and answer the discovery questions during onboarding.
