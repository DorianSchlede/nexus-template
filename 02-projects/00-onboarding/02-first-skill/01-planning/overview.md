# Project Overview: First Skill

**Project ID**: 02-first-skill
**Created**: 2025-11-03
**Type**: Onboarding Project (Step 3 of 4)
**Duration**: 12-15 minutes

---

## Purpose

Extract a repeatable workflow from YOUR actual work and create your first skill through experience-first learning. Teaches skill creation, trigger phrases, and auto-loading mechanics by doing first, explaining after.

**Critical Design**: Uses YOUR first project from Project 01 to find real workflows—not generic examples!

---

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Workflow Identification
- Analyze YOUR first project for repeatable patterns
- Identify workflows that repeat 2+ times per month
- Extract from real work, not abstract concepts

### 2. Skill-Worthiness Evaluation
- Decision framework: Is this worth making a skill?
- Criteria: Frequency, repeatability, time savings
- Practice with YOUR workflow immediately

### 3. Skill Creation Through Experience
- Use create-skill guided workflow
- Learn by doing (create before explaining)
- Experience YAML, trigger phrases, structure hands-on

### 4. Trigger Phrases & Auto-Loading
- Write trigger phrases for YOUR skill
- Test skill working with natural language
- Understand auto-loading AFTER experiencing it (grounded learning)

### 5. Value Connection
- Explicit connection to YOUR goals
- Time savings calculation
- ROI over 3 months

## What You'll Create

By the end of this project, you'll have:

1. **03-skills/[your-skill]/** - First skill extracted from YOUR work
   - SKILL.md with YAML header (name + description + 4+ triggers)
   - Workflow steps (clear, actionable, numbered)
   - Optional: references/, scripts/, assets/ folders if needed

2. **Working auto-loading** - Skill triggers from natural phrases

3. **Clear value** - Understanding of how skill serves your goal

**All based on YOUR actual project work!**

---

## Teaching Approach: Experience → Test → Explain

**The Flow**:
1. **Concrete**: Identify workflow from your actual project
2. **Action**: Create skill using create-skill (no pre-explanation)
3. **Action**: Test skill (experience auto-loading)
4. **Explanation**: Explain mechanics (now grounded in experience)
5. **Value**: Connect to your goals explicitly

**Why This Works**: You have context when learning mechanics because you've already created, tested, and seen your skill working. This achieves 4x better retention than explaining before experience.

---

## Context Flow

**Input**:
- goals.md (YOUR goals and role)
- roadmap.md (YOUR milestones)
- project-map.md (YOUR first project)
- First project from Project 01 (your actual work)

**Loaded via**: `python nexus-loader.py --project 02` (automatic)

**Output**:
- First skill in 03-skills/
- Skill auto-loads from natural triggers
- Updated project-map.md
- Clear understanding of skill creation process

**Next Project**: Project 03 "System Mastery" - Review YOUR complete setup with pitfall identification

## Success Criteria

You've successfully completed this project when:

- [ ] You identified workflow from YOUR first project (concrete, personal)
- [ ] You evaluated skill-worthiness using 3-criteria framework
- [ ] You used create-skill for guided creation (experience-first)
- [ ] First skill extracted from YOUR actual work pattern
- [ ] Skill YAML has 4+ trigger phrase variations
- [ ] You understand skill structure through creating it
- [ ] Skill triggers successfully from natural language
- [ ] You understand auto-loading AFTER experiencing it (grounded)
- [ ] Value explicitly connected to YOUR goal
- [ ] close-session practiced (habit reinforced)

## Time Estimate

**12-15 minutes** (within target ✅)

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Workflow identification | 3-4 min |
| Skill-worthiness evaluation | 2 min |
| Skill creation | 7-8 min |
| Testing | 1 min |
| Explanation + value | 3 min |

---

## Vocabulary Management

**4 terms introduced** (within ≤5 budget ✅):
1. workflow (concrete, from their project)
2. create-skill (tool name, used immediately)
3. trigger phrases (functional, write their own)
4. auto-loading (abstract BUT grounded after testing)

**Deferred to Project 03**:
- nexus-loader.py mechanics
- YAML frontmatter details
- Metadata scanning architecture
- System internals

## Current Status

**Status**: PLANNING
**Progress**: 0/13 tasks complete
**Next Step**: Execute tasks.md in sequence
**Philosophy Score**: 85% (B grade)

---

## Key Design Achievements

1. ✅ **CAVE Compliant**: Experience before explanation (Section 6 after Sections 4-5)
2. ✅ **Vocabulary Controlled**: 4 terms only (60% reduction from typical onboarding)
3. ✅ **Time Efficient**: 12-15 minutes (within target)
4. ✅ **Grounded Learning**: All mechanics explained after user experiences them
5. ✅ **Value Explicit**: Clear connection to user's goals (not implicit)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 85%+ completion rate
- 60%+ vocabulary retention after 24 hours
- 4.2/5 satisfaction rating
- Effective skill creation learning
