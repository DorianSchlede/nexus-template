## Actual Paper Content

### Paper Overview

- **Actual Title**: A Statistical Study of Solar White-Light Flares Observed by the White-light Solar Telescope of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope on the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S/LST/WST) at 360 nm
- **Authors**: Zhichen Jing, Ying Li, Li Feng, Hui Li, Yu Huang, et al.
- **Affiliation**: Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences
- **Journal**: Solar Physics
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Source**: 14-RAG_Ontologic_Graph_Multiagent_LLM.pdf (MISLABELED)
- **Chunks**: 3 chunks, ~69,283 characters
- **Analyzed**: 2025-12-28

### Key Findings (From Actual Paper)

1. **Occurrence Rate** (Chunk 1:325-335): 49 out of 205 M- and X-class flares (23.9%) were identified as white-light flares at 360 nm

2. **Magnitude Correlation** (Chunk 1:330-335): "The percentages of WLFs for M1.0-M4.9 (31 out of 180), M5.0-M9.9 (11 out of 18), and above X1 (7 for all) flares are 17.2%, 61.1%, and 100%, respectively"

3. **Physical Properties** (Chunk 1:396-407): Mean WL duration 10.3 min, mean brightening area 479 arcsec^2, mean enhancement 19.4%

4. **Neupert Effect** (Chunk 1:578-582): "The WL emission at 360 nm reaches its peak around the same time as the temporal derivative of SXR flux as well as the HXR 20-50 keV emission"

5. **Energy Range** (Chunk 1:529-530): "The total flux at 360 nm...for all the 39 WLFs is about 10^26 - 10^30 erg"
