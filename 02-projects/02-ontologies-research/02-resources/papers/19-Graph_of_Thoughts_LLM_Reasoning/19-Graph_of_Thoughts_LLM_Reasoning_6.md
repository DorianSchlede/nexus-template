Table 39: Merging 4 example NDAs: **Step 1 (Scoring Example – Prompt)**


Please score the merged NDA _<_ S _>_ in terms of how much redundant information is contained, independent of the original
NDAs, as well as how much information is retained from the original NDAs.


A score of 10 for redundancy implies that absolutely no information is redundant, while a score of 0 implies that at least half
of the information is redundant (so everything is at least mentioned twice).


A score of 10 for retained information implies that all information from the original NDAs is retained, while a score of 0
implies that no information is retained.


You may provide reasoning for your scoring, but the final score for redundancy should be between the tags _<_ Redundancy _>_
and _<_ /Redundancy _>_, and the final score for retained information should be between the tags _<_ Retained _>_ and _<_ /Retained _>_,
without any additional text within any of those tags.

Table 40: Merging 4 example NDAs: **Step 1 (Scoring Example – Responses)**


**Response (1/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 5 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


_<_ Retained _>_ 10 _<_ /Retained _>_


Reasoning:


In terms of redundancy, there is some overlap in the information contained in the NDAs, such as the definition of ”Confidential Information” and the obligations of the receiving party. However, there are also some unique details in each NDA, such
as the specific purpose of information sharing and the penalties for breach. Overall, there is a moderate level of redundancy
in the merged NDA.


In terms of retained information, all the key elements from the original NDAs are included in the merged NDA. This
includes the agreement between the parties, the purpose of information sharing, the definition of confidential information,
the obligations of the receiving party, the exclusions for confidential information, non-competition clauses, the term and
termination of the agreement, and the general provisions. Therefore, the merged NDA retains all the important information
from the original NDAs.


**Response (2/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 8 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


_<_ Retained _>_ 10 _<_ /Retained _>_


Reasoning:


The merged NDA _<_ S _>_ contains multiple redundant sections from the original NDAs. For example, the introductory sections,
such as the agreement between the parties and the purpose of information sharing, are repeated multiple times. Additionally,
sections related to the definition of confidential information, the recipient’s obligations, exclusions, non-competition, term
and termination, and general provisions are also redundantly included.


However, in terms of retained information, the merged NDA retains all the key elements from the original NDAs, including
the parties involved, the objective, specification of protected information, recipient’s obligations, violation ramifications,
general terms, legal reference, and attestation. Overall, while there is redundancy in the merged NDA, it successfully retains
all the necessary information from the original NDAs.


**Response (3/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 3 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


The merged NDA contains some redundancy. There are three sections that have overlapping information between the original
NDAs. These sections include:


1. The agreement between the parties (Section 1 in Doc1 and the beginning of Doc2)

2. Information sharing and the purpose of the NDA (Section 2 in both Doc1 and Doc2)

3. General provisions such as governing law and amendments (Section 7 in Doc1 and Doc2)


_<_ Retained _>_ 9 _<_ /Retained _>_


The merged NDA retains a significant amount of information from the original NDAs. It includes all key clauses and provisions, such as the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the receiving party, exclusions, non-competition,
and general provisions. Only a few minor details, such as specific penalties and fine amounts, are not retained in the merged
NDA. Overall, the merged NDA effectively combines the essential elements from the original NDAs.


Note: Remember to remove the reasoning from between the tags when providing the final scores.
