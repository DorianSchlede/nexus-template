**Quantitative Conductivity Improvement** : We anticipate that the electrical conductivity of the graphene-amyloid fibril composite will be significantly higher than that of pure
graphene or amyloid fibrils alone. For instance, if pure graphene has a conductivity of ~10^4 S/m, the composite could achieve conductivities in the range of 10^5 to 10^6
S/m.

circuits can precisely regulate the expression levels, secretion rates, and assembly processes of these proteins.
**Quantitative Control** : We expect that the gene circuits will allow for fine-tuning of protein expression with high precision, achieving desired protein concentrations within a
range of 1-100 Î¼M. This control can be validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and protein quantification assays.
