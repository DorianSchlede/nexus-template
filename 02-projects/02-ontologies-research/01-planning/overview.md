# Ontologies Research

## Purpose

**Research Question**: What are the foundational ontologies for digital work, and how do they ground entity definitions, framework comparisons, and AI agent/generative AI integration patterns?

**Research Purpose**: Validate the 8-entity hypothesis (Goal, Task, Rule, Resource, Role, Data, Event, Agent) for UDWO metamodel grounding. Inform internal ontology design for AI agent orchestration platform.

---

## Success Criteria

**Must achieve**:
- [ ] Entity taxonomy validated across foundational ontologies (UFO, DOLCE, BFO, PROV-O)
- [ ] Agent-Activity-Entity triad validated as universal pattern
- [ ] 8-entity hypothesis grounded in academic literature
- [ ] AI integration patterns catalogued

**Nice to have**:
- [ ] Abstraction-entity count relationship documented
- [ ] Framework comparison matrix complete

## Current Status (2025-12-28)

**Schema Migration**: v2.2 → v2.3
- Archive created: `09-ontologies-research-v22-archive`
- _briefing.md updated with `research_purpose` (G22a) ✅
- _analysis_kit.md updated with `synthesis_goals` (G22b) ✅
- 23 papers pending re-analysis with Schema v2.3

**Papers**: 23 analyzed (Schema v2.2), pending upgrade to v2.3

---

## Context

**Background**: Deep research on foundational ontologies to ground the UDWO metamodel for AI agent orchestration.

**Stakeholders**: Mutagent product team, ontology design decisions

**Constraints**: Must use Schema v2.3 with chunk_index and 3-state fields_found for synthesis pipeline compatibility.
