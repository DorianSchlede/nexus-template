# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
