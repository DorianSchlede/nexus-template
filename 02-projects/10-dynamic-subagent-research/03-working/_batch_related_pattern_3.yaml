patterns:
  # From 04-GCC-2508.00031 (Git Context Controller)
  - name: "COMMIT-BRANCH-MERGE Integration"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:117-119)"
    quote: "GCC, a structured context management framework for LLM agents that integrates version control semantics—such as COMMIT, BRANCH, and MERGE into the reasoning loop"
    description: "The three core GCC commands form an interdependent system where COMMIT checkpoints progress, BRANCH enables exploration, and MERGE synthesizes results. These patterns complement each other to create a complete version-control-inspired memory management system."

  - name: "CONTEXT Retrieval Multi-Level Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:338-376)"
    quote: "CONTEXT command allows agents to retrieve memory at multiple levels of granularity, from global overviews to fine-grained token-level execution traces"
    description: "The CONTEXT pattern depends on the file hierarchy created by COMMIT and BRANCH patterns. It provides retrieval across main.md (global), commit.md (milestone), and log.md (fine-grained) levels. This is a dependency relationship where CONTEXT requires prior COMMIT/BRANCH operations."

  - name: "BRANCH Isolation with MERGE Synthesis"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:304-306)"
    quote: "This enables isolated reasoning, where experiments or alternative workflows are sandboxed from the mainline trajectory, yet remain fully inspectable and reversible"
    description: "BRANCH and MERGE are complementary patterns: BRANCH provides isolation for experimentation while MERGE enables synthesis back to mainline. The isolation-synthesis relationship allows safe exploration with controlled integration."

  - name: "RAG Memory Alternative to Summary-Based Memory"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 2:140-170)"
    quote: "Rather than modifying the compressed memory system in-place, we find the agent invoked the BRANCH command to explore an alternate hypothesis that memory could be reimagined as a retriever-augmented knowledge base"
    description: "RAG-style memory and summary-based compression represent alternative patterns for memory management. The GCC-equipped agent explored RAG as an alternative to the simpler compressed summary approach, ultimately choosing the summary pattern due to better performance characteristics."

  # From 07-ProtocolBench (Protocol Comparison)
  - name: "A2A-ACP Protocol Complementarity"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench-2510.17149 (Chunk 2:161-172)"
    quote: "A2A emerges as the superior protocol for overall task utility...Compared to ACP, A2A demonstrates a substantial 10.57% improvement in quality metrics"
    description: "A2A and ACP are related as alternative protocols with different strengths: A2A excels at task utility and hierarchical coordination, while ACP provides better latency characteristics. They can be complementary in heterogeneous deployments."

  - name: "ANP-AGORA Security Complement"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench-2510.17149 (Chunk 2:311-320)"
    quote: "ANP and AGORA provide comprehensive security coverage across all evaluated dimensions, including TLS transport security, session hijacking protection, end-to-end encryption"
    description: "ANP and AGORA share complementary security capabilities that ACP and A2A lack. Both provide TLS transport, tunnel sniffing resistance, and metadata protection. This creates a security-performance trade-off relationship with the other protocols."

  - name: "Protocol Router Multi-Protocol Coordination"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench-2510.17149 (Chunk 2:463-468)"
    quote: "Router deployment strategy...Streaming Queue → ACP (latency-optimized), Fail-Storm → A2A (resilience-focused)...Safety → ANP (secure protocol)"
    description: "The ProtocolRouter pattern coordinates multiple protocols based on scenario requirements. Each protocol addresses specific needs: ACP for latency, A2A for resilience, ANP for security, Agora for governance. This is a coordination pattern enabling heterogeneous protocol usage."

  - name: "UTE Cross-Protocol Bridge"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench-2510.17149 (Chunk 6:35-37)"
    quote: "send_message: Sends a protocol-specific payload and returns the protocol response. PAL unifies encoding/decoding via the UTE (Unified Transport Envelope)"
    description: "The Unified Transport Envelope (UTE) serves as a bridge pattern that enables interoperability between A2A, ACP, ANP, and AGORA protocols. It abstracts protocol differences while preserving message semantics, enabling heterogeneous agent communication."

  - name: "Stateless Bridge for Heterogeneous Links"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench-2510.17149 (Chunk 7:103-116)"
    quote: "We enforce 'change transport, not semantics or security.' Homogeneous links use the chosen protocol natively. Heterogeneous links install stateless bridges around the UTE"
    description: "Stateless bridges complement the UTE pattern by handling encode/decode operations for cross-protocol communication. The bridge pattern depends on UTE for field mapping while preserving business semantics and security attributes."

  # From 08-LACP (LLM Agent Communication Protocol)
  - name: "LACP Three-Layer Architecture Dependencies"
    chunk_ref: "08-LACP-2510.13821 (Chunk 1:185-214)"
    quote: "LACP's architecture implements three mutually-insulated layers, each with well-defined interfaces that enable independent evolution while ensuring system-wide coherence"
    description: "LACP's Semantic, Transactional, and Transport layers form a dependency hierarchy. The Semantic Layer (PLAN/ACT/OBSERVE) depends on the Transactional Layer for integrity, which depends on the Transport Layer for delivery. Layers can evolve independently but must maintain interface contracts."

  - name: "LACP-MCP Complementary Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "08-LACP-2510.13821 (Chunk 1:121-136)"
    quote: "LACP (Proposed) 2025 Open Standard Layered Layered semantics, transactions E2E crypto, 2PC, Auth (core)"
    description: "LACP complements existing protocols like MCP, ACP, ANP, and A2A by providing what they lack: comprehensive layered semantics, transaction guarantees, and built-in end-to-end cryptographic security. LACP is designed to integrate as a foundational layer rather than replace existing systems."

  - name: "JWS Security with Transaction Layer"
    chunk_ref: "08-LACP-2510.13821 (Chunk 1:217-227)"
    quote: "Core LACP message types (all wrapped in a JWS envelope)...PLAN intent_id, role, natural_language...ACT intent_id, tool_call, params...OBSERVE intent_id, status, output"
    description: "The JWS (JSON Web Signature) envelope pattern depends on the Transactional Layer and complements the Semantic Layer message types (PLAN, ACT, OBSERVE). This creates a security wrapper that ensures message integrity and authentication for all semantic operations."

  - name: "Signature Verification with Replay Prevention"
    chunk_ref: "08-LACP-2510.13821 (Chunk 2:165-175)"
    quote: "The server's signature verification passed, but its Transactional Layer logic identified the transaction_id as a duplicate. The server rejected the request and returned an HTTP 409 Conflict"
    description: "Signature verification and transaction ID tracking are complementary security patterns. Signature verification provides message integrity while transaction ID tracking prevents replay attacks. Both are needed for complete application-layer security."

  # From 09-SEMAP (Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol)
  - name: "Behavioral Contracts with Structured Messaging"
    chunk_ref: "09-SEMAP-2510.12120 (Chunk 1:159-172)"
    quote: "SEMAP comprises three core principles...Explicit behavioral contract modeling...Structured messaging...Lifecycle-guided execution with verification"
    description: "SEMAP's three principles form interdependent patterns: behavioral contracts define agent responsibilities, structured messaging ensures clear communication between contracted agents, and lifecycle execution verifies that contracts are fulfilled. Each principle addresses different failure categories."

  - name: "Design by Contract with Verification Gates"
    chunk_ref: "09-SEMAP-2510.12120 (Chunk 1:178-208)"
    quote: "In traditional SE, DbC establishes a formal agreement between software components, including pre-conditions define what must be true before execution, and post-conditions define what must hold afterward"
    description: "Behavioral contracts (inspired by Design by Contract) and verification gates are complementary patterns. Contracts define IC (input conditions) and OC (output conditions), while lifecycle-guided verification ensures these conditions are met at stage transitions."

  - name: "SEMAP on A2A Infrastructure"
    chunk_ref: "09-SEMAP-2510.12120 (Chunk 1:85-92)"
    quote: "SEMAP is implemented as a lightweight protocol middleware atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure and supports both centralized and decentralized workflows"
    description: "SEMAP depends on A2A as its underlying infrastructure while adding domain-specific SE principles. This is a layering relationship where SEMAP extends A2A with behavioral contracts, structured messaging, and lifecycle verification for software engineering tasks."

  - name: "FSM Lifecycle with Stage Verification"
    chunk_ref: "09-SEMAP-2510.12120 (Chunk 1:244-266)"
    quote: "a task lifecycle is modeled as a finite state machine (FSM): L = (S, Sigma, delta, s0, F) where S: a set of lifecycle stages (e.g., initialized, implementing, reviewing, completed, failed)"
    description: "The FSM lifecycle pattern and verification outcomes form a dependency relationship. State transitions (delta function) depend on verification results (Sigma: pass/fail), ensuring that progression is gated by validation. This prevents premature or invalid termination."

  # From 10-TalkHier (Hierarchical Communication)
  - name: "Structured Communication with Hierarchical Refinement"
    chunk_ref: "10-TalkHier-2502.11098 (Chunk 1:125-131)"
    quote: "TalkHier -the first collaborative LLM-MA framework to integrate a well-structured communication protocol with hierarchical refinement"
    description: "TalkHier integrates two complementary patterns: structured communication protocol (M, B, I components) and hierarchical refinement (supervisor-member teams). The communication protocol enables context-rich exchanges that the hierarchical refinement system uses for coordinated feedback."

  - name: "Message-Background-IntermediateOutput Triad"
    chunk_ref: "10-TalkHier-2502.11098 (Chunk 1:299-307)"
    quote: "c(t)ij = (M(t)ij, B(t)ij, I(t)ij), where M indicates the message content...B denotes background information...I refers to the intermediate output"
    description: "The three components of TalkHier's communication protocol form interdependent elements: Messages (M) provide instructions, Background (B) ensures coherence with context, and Intermediate Output (I) supports traceability. All three are needed for efficient agent communication."

  - name: "Supervisor-Member Team Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "10-TalkHier-2502.11098 (Chunk 1:410-427)"
    quote: "The entire graph G consists of multiple teams...A key feature of the hierarchical structure in TalkHier is that a member agent in one team can also act as a supervisor for another team"
    description: "The supervisor-member pattern enables nested hierarchies where roles can span multiple teams. Main team (Generator, Revisor) and Evaluation team (Evaluators) are connected through the evaluation Supervisor who serves dual roles. This creates recursive team composition."

  - name: "Evaluation Supervisor Aggregation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "10-TalkHier-2502.11098 (Chunk 2:39-51)"
    quote: "The evaluation Supervisor aggregates and summarizes this feedback (F_eval_summary) before passing it to the main Supervisor. The main Supervisor evaluates whether the summarized feedback meets the quality threshold"
    description: "The Evaluation Supervisor serves as a feedback aggregation layer between individual evaluators and the main supervisor. This pattern complements the individual evaluator pattern by preventing information overload and bias from direct feedback exposure."

  - name: "Agent-Specific Memory with Independent Persistence"
    chunk_ref: "10-TalkHier-2502.11098 (Chunk 1:272-283)"
    quote: "each agent maintains an independent memory, Memory_i. Unlike long-term memory, which relies on a shared memory pool...our proposed memory mechanism is agent-specific but not limited to session"
    description: "Agent-specific memory is presented as an alternative to both shared memory pools and session-limited short-term memory. It provides independence (no centralized dependencies) and persistence (cross-session continuity) as complementary capabilities."

  # From 12-CollabSurvey (Multi-Agent Collaboration Survey)
  - name: "Cooperation-Competition-Coopetition Spectrum"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:241-250)"
    quote: "Cooperation in LLM-based MASs occurs when agents align their individual objectives with a shared collective goal...Competition happens when there are conflicting objectives"
    description: "Cooperation, competition, and coopetition form a spectrum of collaboration types. Cooperation aligns objectives (union of goals), competition involves conflicting objectives, and coopetition blends both. These are alternative patterns that can be combined in hybrid collaboration channels."

  - name: "Role-Based with Cooperation Strategy"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:257-261)"
    quote: "Similarly, MetaGPT uses an assembly line model, assigning roles and encoding Standardised Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts to enhance structured coordination"

Role assignment enables task specialization, while cooperation ensures aligned objectives. The combination enhances structured coordination for software development tasks."

  - name: "Competition with Refinement Loop"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:383-389)"
    quote: "in LEGO, a multi-agent collaborative framework is introduced for causality explanation generation, where the competition collaborative link is also pre-defined. The collaboration consists of 2 LLMs, one serves as Explainer with initial output, and another one acts as Critic"
    description: "Competition and iterative refinement form a complementary pattern where competitive dynamics (Explainer vs. Critic) drive output quality improvement. The Explainer-Critic pattern uses competition as a refinement mechanism rather than pure rivalry."

  - name: "Hybrid Collaboration Channel Coordination"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:418-440)"
    quote: "In LLM-based MASs, there is often the need for complex interactions that transcend singular collaboration types like competition or cooperation. Different agents may participate in different collaboration channels"
    description: "Hybrid collaboration combines multiple channel types (competition and cooperation) in a single system. For example, debating agents compete while a judge agent cooperates with both. This coordination pattern leverages the strengths of different collaboration types for complex objectives."

  - name: "Rule-Based with Consensus Seeking"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:479-490)"
    quote: "research on consensus seeking in MASs highlights how rule-based strategies enable agents to negotiate and align their actions toward a shared goal, with applications in multi-robot aggregation tasks"
    description: "Rule-based strategies and consensus seeking are complementary patterns. Predefined rules govern agent interactions while consensus mechanisms enable negotiation and alignment. Together they provide predictability with collective decision-making capability."

  - name: "Mixture-of-Experts as Coopetition"
    chunk_ref: "12-CollabSurvey-2501.06322 (Chunk 2:409-415)"
    quote: "In MoE, multiple expert models compete to contribute to the final output, with a gating mechanism selecting the most appropriate experts for each input"
    description: "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) exemplifies the coopetition pattern where experts compete for selection while cooperating to enhance overall model performance. The gating mechanism coordinates the coopetitive relationship, selecting specialists based on input characteristics."
