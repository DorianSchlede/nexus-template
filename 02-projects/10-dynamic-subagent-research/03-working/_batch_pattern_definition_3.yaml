    quote: "Minimal required fields: src, dst, content, context. In BaseAgent.send(), UTE.new(...) produces the envelope..."
    description: "A unified message envelope pattern that standardizes inter-protocol communication. UTE provides a protocol-agnostic wrapper containing source, destination, content, and context fields.

  - name: "Protocol Adapter Abstraction (BaseProtocolAdapter)"
    chunk_ref: "07-ProtocolBench (Chunk 6:21-23)"
