  # ACE Paper Patterns (01-ACE-2510.04618)

  - name: "Context-as-Playbook Generation Integration"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:111-117)"
    quote: "ACE treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate and organize strategies over time...modular workflow of generation, reflection, and curation"
    description: "Integration point at prompt_generation phase. ACE integrates context adaptation by treating the system prompt as an evolving playbook that is constructed before task execution. The Generator produces reasoning trajectories, which are then processed through the Reflector and Curator before being assembled into the final context."

  - name: "Delta Context Incremental Update Integration"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:282-304)"
    quote: "Rather than regenerating contexts in full, ACE incrementally produces compact delta contexts: small sets of candidate bullets distilled by the Reflector"
    description: "Integration point at handover phase. Delta updates are produced during the handover between Generator and Curator stages. The Reflector distills insights into compact delta entries which are then merged deterministically by lightweight non-LLM logic, enabling parallel merging of multiple deltas."

  - name: "Itemized Bullet Localization Integration"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:285-296)"
    quote: "itemized design enables three key properties: (1) localization, so only the relevant bullets are updated; (2) fine-grained retrieval; (3) incremental adaptation"
    description: "Integration point at verification phase. The bullet-based structure enables localization where only relevant bullets are updated after execution. The Generator highlights which bullets were useful or misleading during task execution, providing feedback that guides the Reflector in proposing corrective updates."

  - name: "ACE Generator Playbook Injection"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:75-89)"
    quote: "You are also provided with a curated cheatsheet of strategies, API-specific information...ACE Playbook: - Read the **Playbook** first, then execute the task"

  - name: "ACE Reflector Trajectory Analysis Integration"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:151-162)"
    quote: "Your job is to diagnose the current trajectory: identify what went wrong...Take the environment feedback into account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth"

    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:159-162)"
    quote: "You will receive bulletpoints that are part of playbook...give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral']"
    description: "Integration point at verification phase. During reflection, each playbook bullet is tagged as helpful, harmful, or neutral. This tagging occurs post-execution and provides feedback that guides which bullets should be emphasized, modified, or removed in future iterations."

  - name: "ACE Curator Playbook Update Integration"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:330-341)"
    quote: "Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a reflection...Identify ONLY the NEW insights that are MISSING"
    description: "Integration point at handover phase. The Curator receives the reflection output and performs delta updates to the playbook. It operates at the handover boundary between execution cycles, synthesizing lessons into the persistent playbook structure."

  - name: "ACE Section-Based Add Operations"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:442-459)"
    quote: "operations: a list of operations...ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs - section: the section to add the bullet to - content: the new content"
    description: "Integration point at handover phase. The Curator performs structured ADD operations to specific playbook sections during the handover between task iterations. This structured operation format ensures consistent integration of new knowledge into appropriate sections."

  - name: "Bullet ID Tracking for Generator Feedback"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 5:78-81)"
    quote: "bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that's relevant, helpful for you to answer this question"
    description: "Integration point at execution phase. During task execution, the Generator tracks which bullet_ids from the playbook were actually used. This enables attribution tracking throughout the execution phase, supporting later verification and refinement."
