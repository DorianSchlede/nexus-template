  - name: "Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) Framework"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:24-27)"
    quote: "ACE treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation"
    description: "Core framework pattern for context adaptation. ACE prevents context collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. The pattern operates in both offline (system prompt optimization) and online (test-time memory adaptation) settings."
    mechanism_type: "enforcement"
    confidence: "high"

  - name: "Dynamic Cheatsheet Adaptive Memory"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:114-116)"
    quote: "Building on the agentic architecture of Dynamic Cheatsheet, ACE incorporates a modular workflow of generation, reflection, and curation"
    description: "Pattern for test-time learning with adaptive external memory. Introduces an adaptive memory of reusable strategies and code snippets that continuously updates with newly encountered inputs and outputs. Does not require ground-truth labels - model curates its own memory from generations."
    mechanism_type: "verification"
    confidence: "high"

  - name: "Generator-Reflector-Curator Division of Labor"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:214-218)"
    quote: "ACE introduces a structured division of labor across three roles: the Generator, which produces reasoning trajectories; the Reflector, which distills concrete insights; and the Curator"
    description: "Three-component agentic architecture pattern. The Generator produces reasoning trajectories; the Reflector critiques traces to extract lessons; the Curator synthesizes lessons into compact delta entries merged deterministically. Mirrors human learning process of experimenting, reflecting, and consolidating."

    confidence: "high"

  - name: "Incremental Delta Updates"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:285-296)"
    quote: "context as a collection of structured, itemized bullets with metadata including unique identifier and counters tracking how often it was marked helpful or harmful"
    description: "Pattern for context representation as structured bullets rather than monolithic prompts. Each bullet contains: (1) metadata with unique ID and helpful/harmful counters, (2) content capturing strategies, domain concepts, or failure modes. Enables localization, fine-grained retrieval, and incremental adaptation."
    mechanism_type: "verification"

    description: "Anti-pattern identification. Addresses the tendency of context adaptation methods to collapse toward short, generic prompts that omit domain-specific heuristics, tool-use guidelines, and failure modes. ACE counters this by treating contexts as comprehensive playbooks rather than concise summaries."
    mechanism_type: "prevention"
    confidence: "high"

  - name: "Context Collapse Prevention"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:186-199)"

    description: "Anti-pattern identification and prevention. Context collapse occurs during monolithic rewriting when LLMs compress large contexts into shorter summaries, causing dramatic information loss. Example: 18,282 tokens collapsed to 122 tokens with accuracy dropping from 66.7 to 57.1."
