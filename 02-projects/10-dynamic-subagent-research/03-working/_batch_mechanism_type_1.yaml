  # ACE Paper Patterns (01-ACE-2510.04618)

  - name: "Context Collapse Prevention"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:186-199)"
    quote: "context collapse, which arises when an LLM is tasked with fully rewriting the accumulated context at each adaptation step"
    description: "Prevention mechanism that addresses context degradation through incremental delta updates rather than monolithic rewrites. When context is fully rewritten, it collapses from thousands of tokens to much shorter summaries, causing dramatic information loss. ACE prevents this through structured, incremental updates."

  - name: "Brevity Bias Prevention"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:89-98)"
    quote: "brevity bias: many prompt optimizers prioritize concise, broadly applicable instructions over comprehensive accumulation"
    description: "Prevention mechanism that counteracts the tendency of optimization to collapse toward short, generic prompts. ACE treats contexts as evolving playbooks that preserve detailed, domain-specific knowledge rather than compressing it away."

  - name: "Reflector Verification"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:214-218)"
    quote: "the Reflector, which distills concrete insights from successes and errors"

  - name: "Incremental Delta Updates"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:282-304)"
    quote: "ACE incrementally produces compact delta contexts: small sets of candidate bullets distilled by the Reflector and integrated by the Curator"

  - name: "Grow-and-Refine Redundancy Control"

  - name: "Playbook Tag Classification"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:159-160)"
    quote: "analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for each bulletpoint, tag can be ['helpful', 'harmful', 'neutral']"
    description: "Verification mechanism where the Reflector classifies each playbook entry as helpful, harmful, or neutral for generating correct answers. Enables systematic quality assessment of context components."

  - name: "API Schema Curation"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:161-162)"
    quote: "Explicitly curate from the environment feedback the output format/schema of APIs used when unclear or mismatched with expectations"
    description: "Detection mechanism that identifies mismatches between expected and actual API output formats. Captures schema clarifications to prevent future errors from format assumptions."

  - name: "Root Cause Analysis"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:228-238)"
    quote: "error_identification: The agent used unreliable heuristics... root_cause_analysis: The agent misunderstood the data architecture"
    description: "Detection mechanism in the Reflector that identifies specific conceptual errors, calculation mistakes, or misapplied strategies. Traces errors to fundamental misunderstandings rather than surface symptoms."

  - name: "Redundancy Avoidance in Curation"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 4:337-339)"
    quote: "Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that is a perfect complement to the existing playbook"
    description: "Prevention mechanism in the Curator that explicitly checks for existing similar content before adding new entries. Prevents playbook bloat through systematic redundancy checking."
