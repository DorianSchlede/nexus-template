  # Paper 18: HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 Patterns
  - name: "Agent Hallucination Taxonomy"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 1:230-237)"
    quote: "We introduce a novel decomposition of agent components into two parts: internal state and external behaviors..."
    description: "A comprehensive taxonomy pattern that classifies agent hallucinations into five types based on internal state (belief state) versus external behaviors (reasoning, execution, perception, memorization, communication). This pattern provides a structured framework for identifying where in the agent pipeline handover failures and hallucinations occur."

  - name: "POMDP Agent Loop Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 1:342-356)"
    quote: "Reasoning, Execution, Feedback, Environment Transition, Perception, Memorization, Belief Update"
    description: "Defines the complete agent execution loop as a sequence of operations: Reasoning generates plan from belief state, Execution translates to action, Feedback provides reward, Perception observes new state, Memorization updates memory, Belief Update refines internal state. This pattern is fundamental for understanding where handover points exist in agent workflows."

  - name: "MAS Broadcasting and Structure Evolution Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 1:421-428)"
    quote: "Broadcasting means that the agent broadcasts its message to neighboring nodes according to its plan, while structure evolution indicates that the communication structure Gt can be updated"
    description: "Extends single-agent loop to multi-agent systems with two additional procedures: Broadcasting (message dissemination to network neighbors) and Structure Evolution (dynamic updating of communication topology). Critical for understanding inter-agent handover protocols."

  - name: "Goal Understanding Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 1:441-451)"
    quote: "I = Understand(b0, g) where I denotes the inferred intention, and b0 represents the initial belief state"
    description: "Pattern for parsing user goals into agent intentions before execution. When intention I is complex, decomposition into sub-intentions occurs. This is the first handover point where miscommunication can introduce errors into the system."

  - name: "Intention Decomposition Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 2:53-69)"
    quote: "Two decomposition methods: pre-defined decomposition and dynamic decomposition...dynamically optimized based on the current belief state bt"
    description: "Pattern for breaking complex intentions into manageable sub-intentions. Pre-defined decomposition specifies sub-intentions in advance, while dynamic decomposition generates them iteratively based on evolving belief state. Handover quality depends on accurate dependency modeling between sub-intentions."

  - name: "Sub-intention Dependency Chain Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 2:154-175)"
    quote: "These sub-intentions typically form a sequentially dependent chain, where the completion of each sub-intention pre-supposes the successful fulfillment of its predecessors"
    description: "Pattern describing the sequential dependency relationships between sub-intentions. Failures manifest as Sub-intention Omission (missing critical steps), Sub-intention Redundancy (task-irrelevant additions), and Sub-intentions Disorder (wrong sequencing). Proper handover requires preserving these dependencies."

  - name: "Tool Selection and Calling Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 2:227-249)"
    quote: "Ts = Select(bt, pt, Tcand)...at = Call(bt, pt, Ts)"
    description: "Two-phase execution pattern: Tool Selection retrieves and selects appropriate tool from candidates, Tool Calling populates parameters to form executable action. This is a critical handover point where documentation limitations, shallow pattern understanding, or solvability unawareness can cause execution hallucinations."

  - name: "Memory Retrieval and Update Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 2:370-373)"
    quote: "Memory Retrieval: Extracting and integrating relevant information from stored memory...Memory Update: revising and removing existing memory"
    description: "Pattern for memory operations in agents with two core functions: retrieval (extracting relevant stored information for current decision) and update (revising/removing based on new information/feedback). Sub-optimal retrieval mechanisms or imperfect priority assignment cause memorization hallucinations."

  - name: "Communication Protocol Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 2:457-474)"
    quote: "Communication protocols govern how agents exchange messages, directly determining the efficiency, reliability, and coordination of their interactions"
    description: "Pattern for inter-agent communication in MAS covering three aspects: Asynchronous Scheduling (temporal coordination), Message Formats (natural language vs structured JSON), and Fault-tolerant Design (confirmation/synchronization constraints). Uncoordinated protocols lead to communication hallucinations."

  - name: "Self-verification Mechanism Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 4:17-39)"
    quote: "Self-verification is a lightweight and model-internal approach wherein agents assess the validity and reliability of their own outputs without relying on external validators"
    description: "Pattern for agent self-assessment through three techniques: Self-reflection (prompting introspection), Self-consistency (multiple candidate generation with voting), and Self-questioning (verification questions based on reasoning process). Enables autonomous error detection in handovers."

  - name: "Validator Assistance Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 4:42-48)"
    quote: "This approach leverages external validators to verify the correctness of an agent's outputs, aiming to mitigate hallucinations"
    description: "Pattern for external verification using five validator categories: Language-based (truthfulness/coherence), Retrieval-based (external source checking), Execution-based (running generated code), Simulation-based (sandboxed testing), and Ensemble-based (combining multiple validators). Critical for post-handover verification."

  - name: "Hallucinatory Accumulation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 4:153-169)"
    quote: "hallucinations can accumulate and amplify over time. In such cases, hallucinations may initially appear as minor issues, but their iterative accumulation can ultimately lead to severe consequences"
    description: "Pattern describing how errors propagate and compound across multi-step agent processes. Single-step errors magnify into severe consequences through iterative accumulation. This pattern emphasizes the need for early detection and mitigation in handover chains."

  - name: "Lightweight Checkpoint Injection Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-HallucinationSurvey-2509.18970 (Chunk 4:186-189)"

    quote: "we propose HalMit, a fine-grained approach for modeling per-agent generalization bounds to monitor hallucinations that fall outside these boundaries"
    description: "Pattern for identifying agent-specific generalization bounds within domains. Uses a watchdog framework to detect when generated responses exceed the agent's reliable knowledge boundary, flagging potential hallucinations. The bound is domain-specific rather than universal."

    chunk_ref: "19-HalMit-2507.15903 (Chunk 1:375-390)"
    quote: "FT1: Semantic Deduction...FT2: Semantic Analog...FT3: Semantic Induction"
    description: "Pattern using three fractal affine transformations to systematically explore an agent's generalization boundary: Semantic Deduction (specific queries from general concepts), Semantic Analog (broadening via synonyms/analogies), and Semantic Induction (abstracting from specific instances). Enables comprehensive boundary identification."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Bound Exploration Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "19-HalMit-2507.15903 (Chunk 1:355-396)"
    quote: "the proposed MAS consists of three specialized agent types: core agent (CA), query generation agent (QGA), and evaluation agent (EA)"
    description: "Pattern using specialized agent roles for hallucination detection: Core Agent coordinates exploration, Query Generation Agents create test queries through fractal transformations, Evaluation Agent assesses response quality using HalluBench criteria. Demonstrates structured inter-agent handover for quality assurance."

  - name: "Vector Database Boundary Storage Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "19-HalMit-2507.15903 (Chunk 2:82-98)"
    quote: "the CA embeds the QA pair and the context information into a vector database as a point of the generalization bound of agent"
    description: "Pattern for storing identified generalization boundary points as query-response pairs with context in a vector database. When hallucination is reported, the QA pair is embedded and stored. During monitoring, input queries are compared against stored boundary points using cosine similarity."

  - name: "Semantic Entropy-Based Hallucination Detection Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "19-HalMit-2507.15903 (Chunk 3:1-5)"
    quote: "we compare the semantic entropy of the query with the semantic entropy of the most similar vector in the vector database. If HQ is larger, the input query is likely to be outside the generalization bound"
    description: "Pattern using semantic entropy comparison for hallucination detection. Queries with higher semantic entropy than similar boundary points are flagged as potential hallucinations. Provides a quantitative threshold mechanism for handover quality verification."

  # Paper 22: PROV-AGENT-2508.02866 Patterns

    chunk_ref: "22-PROV-AGENT-2508.02866 (Chunk 1:29-38)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP)...to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance"
    description: "Pattern extending W3C PROV standard to capture agentic workflow provenance. Integrates MCP concepts for representing agent tools, prompts, responses, and model invocations within unified provenance graphs. Enables traceability and root cause analysis for agent handovers."

  - name: "AIAgent Tool Execution Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "22-PROV-AGENT-2508.02866 (Chunk 1:285-296)"
    quote: "an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool) and each tool may be informed by one or many AIModelInvocations. Each AIModelInvocation uses a Prompt and a specific AIModel"
    description: "Pattern modeling agent tool executions with full provenance: AgentTool activities linked to AIAgent, informed by AIModelInvocations that use Prompts and specific AIModels, generating ResponseData attributed to the agent. Captures complete handover chain for audit."

Essential for debugging handover failures."

  - name: "Iterative Decision Propagation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "22-PROV-AGENT-2508.02866 (Chunk 2:36-45)"
    quote: "the decision made for each layer informs the decision logic in the next, enabling the system to learn over the course of a print. However, because the agent relies on an LLM, there is a risk of hallucinated or incorrect outputs"
    description: "Pattern describing iterative agent decisions where each decision influences subsequent decision logic. A single error can propagate across iterations, compromising downstream outputs. Provenance tracking becomes essential for identifying where handover corruption began."

  - name: "Hierarchical Agents Collaboration Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "24-EffectiveCollab-2412.05449 (Chunk 1:57-59)"
    quote: "In a centralized hierarchy, a supervisor agent oversees and assigns tasks to specialist agents. The figure demonstrates a multi-layer hierarchy, where an agent can function as both a specialist agent and a supervisor agent"
