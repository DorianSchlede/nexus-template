  # ===== ACE Paper (01-ACE-2510.04618) Limitations =====

  - name: "Brevity Bias in Prompt Optimization"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:89-94)"
    quote: "brevity bias: many prompt optimizers prioritize concise, broadly applicable instructions over comprehensive accumulation"
    description: "Context adaptation methods suffer from brevity bias where optimization collapses toward short, generic prompts. GEPA highlights brevity as strength, but such abstraction omits domain-specific heuristics, tool-use guidelines, or common failure modes that matter in practice. This undermines performance in domains requiring detailed, context-rich guidance."

  - name: "Context Collapse via Monolithic Rewriting"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:186-199)"
    quote: "context collapse, which arises when an LLM is tasked with fully rewriting the accumulated context at each adaptation step"
    description: "When LLMs perform monolithic context rewriting, they tend to compress large contexts into shorter, less informative summaries. Example: at step 60, context contained 18,282 tokens with 66.7% accuracy, but at step 61 collapsed to 122 tokens with accuracy dropping to 57.1% - worse than the 63.7% baseline without adaptation."

  - name: "Reflector Dependency for Context Quality"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 3:103-106)"
    quote: "A potential limitation of ACE is its reliance on a reasonably strong Reflector: if the Reflector fails to extract meaningful insights"
    description: "ACE's effectiveness depends critically on having a Reflector capable of extracting meaningful insights from generated traces or outcomes. In domain-specific tasks where no model can extract useful insights, the resulting context will naturally lack them. This dependency is similar to Dynamic Cheatsheet where quality hinges on the model's curation ability."

  - name: "Context Pollution from Unreliable Feedback"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 2:127-132)"
    quote: "when ground-truth supervision or reliable execution signals are absent, both ACE and DC may degrade in performance"
    description: "When ground-truth supervision or reliable execution signals are absent, context adaptation methods including ACE and Dynamic Cheatsheet may degrade. The constructed context can be polluted by spurious or misleading signals. ACE's effectiveness depends on availability of signals allowing the Reflector and Curator to make sound judgments."

  - name: "Inapplicability for Simple Tasks"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 3:107-113)"
    quote: "not all applications require rich or detailed contexts. Tasks like HotPotQA often benefit more from concise, high-level instructions"
    description: "ACE is not universally beneficial. Tasks like HotPotQA benefit more from concise, high-level instructions rather than long contexts. Games with fixed strategies like Game of 24 may only need a single reusable rule, rendering additional context redundant. ACE is most beneficial for settings demanding detailed domain knowledge, complex tool use, or environment-specific strategies."

  - name: "Fundamental Statelessness"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:111-115)"
    quote: "LLMs inherently process each interaction independently, lacking native mechanisms to maintain state across sequential exchanges"
    description: "LLMs lack native mechanisms to maintain state across sequential exchanges and robust self-validation mechanisms - constraints stemming from fundamental limits identified in Godel's incompleteness theorems. This fundamental statelessness necessitates explicit management systems to maintain coherent operation sequences and ensure robust failure recovery."

  - name: "Context Overflow vs Context Collapse Tradeoff"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:115-118)"
    quote: "opposing challenges of context window overflow, where models 'forget' prior context due to exceeding window limits"
    description: "Context management faces opposing challenges: context window overflow where models forget prior context due to exceeding window limits, and context collapse where enlarged context windows or conversational memory cause models to fail in distinguishing between different conversational contexts."

  - name: "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Limitations"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:118-120)"
