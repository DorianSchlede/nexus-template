patterns:
  - name: "Context Collapse Failure"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:182-199)"
    quote: "at step 60 the context contained 18,282 tokens and achieved an accuracy of 66.7, but at the very next step it collapsed to just 122 tokens, with accuracy dropping to 57.1"
    description: "A critical failure mode where monolithic LLM context rewriting causes sudden information loss. When an LLM is tasked with fully rewriting accumulated context at each adaptation step, it tends to compress it into much shorter, less informative summaries. This causes dramatic loss of information - accuracy dropped from 66.7% to 57.1% (worse than the 63.7% baseline without adaptation). This is a fundamental risk of end-to-end context rewriting where accumulated knowledge can be abruptly erased instead of preserved."

  - name: "Brevity Bias Degradation"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:89-98)"
    quote: "brevity bias: many prompt optimizers prioritize concise, broadly applicable instructions over comprehensive accumulation... such abstraction can omit domain-specific heuristics"
    description: "A failure mode where optimization for conciseness causes loss of critical domain-specific details. Prompt optimizers like GEPA highlight brevity as a strength, but this can omit tool-use guidelines, common failure modes, and heuristics that matter in practice. The brevity objective may align with validation metrics in some settings but often fails to capture detailed strategies required by agents and knowledge-intensive applications."

  - name: "Monolithic Rewriting Information Loss"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:94-99)"
    quote: "methods that rely on monolithic rewriting by an LLM often degrade into shorter, less informative summaries over time, causing sharp performance declines"
    description: "Failure mode in context adaptation where iterative rewriting causes progressive degradation. In domains such as interactive agents, domain-specific programming, and financial/legal analysis, strong performance depends on retaining detailed, task-specific knowledge rather than compressing it away. The monolithic rewriting approach fails to preserve this essential knowledge."

  - name: "Feedback Quality Dependency Failure"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:469-472)"
    quote: "in the absence of reliable feedback signals (e.g., ground-truth labels or execution outcomes), both ACE and other adaptive methods such as Dynamic Cheatsheet may degrade"
    description: "Context adaptation methods critically depend on feedback quality. When reliable feedback signals like ground-truth labels or execution outcomes are unavailable, adaptive methods including ACE and Dynamic Cheatsheet can degrade in performance. This suggests that context adaptation depends critically on feedback quality - a key failure mode when operating in environments without strong supervisory signals."

  - name: "Lost-in-the-Middle Phenomenon"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:103-108)"
    quote: "LLMs struggle to access information positioned in middle sections of long contexts, performing significantly better when relevant information appears at the beginning or end of inputs"
    description: "A positional bias failure where LLMs fail to access information in middle sections of long contexts. This severely impacts performance in extended chain-of-thought reasoning tasks where critical earlier results become susceptible to forgetting. Performance can degrade drastically by as much as 73% compared to performance with no prior context."

  - name: "Context Window Overflow vs Collapse"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:115-117)"
    quote: "Context management faces opposing challenges of context window overflow, where models 'forget' prior context due to exceeding window limits, and context collapse"
    description: "A dual failure mode in context management: (1) context window overflow causes models to 'forget' prior context when window limits are exceeded, and (2) context collapse occurs when enlarged context windows or conversational memory cause models to fail in distinguishing between different conversational contexts. These are opposing but related failure modes requiring different mitigation strategies."

  - name: "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Degradation"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 4:118-120)"
    quote: "Research demonstrates that claimed benefits of chain-of-thought prompting don't stem from genuine algorithmic learning but rather depend on problem-specific prompts, with benefits deteriorating as problem complexity increases"
    description: "Chain-of-thought prompting shows diminishing returns as problem complexity increases. The benefits don't stem from genuine algorithmic learning but depend on problem-specific prompts. This is a failure mode for complex reasoning tasks where CoT was expected to provide robust improvements."

  - name: "Transactional Integrity Failure in Multi-Agent Systems"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 6:435-439)"
    quote: "LangGraph provides basic state management while lacking atomicity guarantees and systematic compensation mechanisms, AutoGen prioritizes flexible agent interactions without adequate compensatory action management"
    description: "Multi-agent orchestration frameworks fail to maintain transactional integrity across complex workflows. LangGraph lacks atomicity guarantees and compensation mechanisms. AutoGen lacks adequate compensatory action management, potentially resulting in inconsistent system states following partial failures. Systems relying exclusively on LLM self-validation capabilities are exposed to reasoning errors, hallucinations, and inter-agent inconsistencies."

  - name: "Context Handling Failures in Agents"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:46-53)"
    quote: "agents struggle with long-term context maintenance encompassing both episodic and semantic information... environmental misconfigurations and LLM hallucinations can distract agentic systems, with poor recovery leading to goal deviation"
    description: "Agents face compound failure modes: (1) struggle with long-term context maintenance for both episodic and semantic information, (2) central orchestrator topologies introduce non-deterministic execution paths complicating anomaly detection, (3) environmental misconfigurations and LLM hallucinations distract agents, and (4) poor recovery leads to goal deviation amplified in multi-agent setups with distributed subtasks."

  - name: "Inter-Agent Dependency Opacity"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:56-58)"
    quote: "Inter-agent dependency opacity presents additional concerns as agents may operate on inconsistent assumptions or conflicting data without explicit constraints or validation layers"
    description: "In multi-agent systems, agents may operate on inconsistent assumptions or conflicting data without explicit constraints or validation layers. This opacity in inter-agent dependencies necessitates anomaly detection incorporating reasoning over orchestration intent and planning coherence. Without such mechanisms, agents can produce inconsistent outputs."

  - name: "Memory System Statelessness Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 6:36-39)"
    quote: "most contemporary LLM-based agents operate in fundamentally stateless manners, treating interactions independently without truly accumulating knowledge incrementally over time"
    description: "A fundamental architectural failure mode where LLM-based agents treat interactions independently without accumulating knowledge incrementally over time. This limitation prevents genuine lifelong learning assessment - a cornerstone of human-level intelligence involving continuous knowledge acquisition, retention, and reuse across diverse contexts and extended time horizons."

  - name: "Memory Evaluation Isolation Problem"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 6:45-48)"
    quote: "Methodological issues arise when isolating memory-specific performance from other intelligence aspects, challenging determination of whether failures stem from inadequate memory mechanisms or reasoning limitations"
    description: "A methodological failure mode in memory system evaluation where it's difficult to isolate memory-specific performance from other intelligence aspects. This makes it challenging to determine whether failures stem from inadequate memory mechanisms or reasoning limitations. Dynamic memory usage in real-world applications poses additional evaluation challenges as controlled tests inadequately capture performance in complex scenarios."

  - name: "Commercial Assistant Memory Degradation"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 6:4-7)"
    quote: "demonstrating 30% accuracy degradation in commercial assistants throughout prolonged interactions"
    description: "Commercial AI assistants (including GPT-4, Claude variants, and Llama 3.1) show 30% accuracy degradation during prolonged interactions. Cutting-edge models encounter difficulties with episodic memory challenges involving interconnected events or intricate spatio-temporal associations even in comparatively brief contexts. This represents a critical production failure mode."

  - name: "Single-Agent Baseline Hallucination"
    chunk_ref: "03-ClaudeCode-2508.08322 (Chunk 2:57-63)"
    quote: "The baseline often guessed function or variable names (e.g. referring to a non-existent getEvents() API) which then caused failures"
    description: "Single-agent code assistants without proper context retrieval hallucinate non-existent functions and APIs. The baseline attempted to use a refreshToken() call that did not exist, whereas multi-agent systems with proper context consultation correctly utilized existing functions. This failure mode demonstrates the importance of semantic code retrieval providing real definitions to agents."

  - name: "Incomplete Task Execution in Single-Agent"
    chunk_ref: "03-ClaudeCode-2508.08322 (Chunk 1:89-90)"
    quote: "a baseline single-agent Claude often omitted needed steps... might miss necessary edits in distant files or misuse an unfamiliar library"
    description: "Single-agent code assistants with basic context prompts produce incomplete solutions for non-trivial features. They miss necessary edits in distant files and misuse unfamiliar libraries, reflecting insufficient context comprehension. The baseline produced only the React component and forgot to update the registry and type definitions, resulting in runtime errors."

  - name: "Session Context Erasure"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:47-49)"
    quote: "closing a session and starting a new one typically erases the agent's memory of prior goals, user preferences, and task-specific instruction. As a result, users are forced to repeatedly 'teach' the model from scratch"
    description: "A critical failure mode where closing an agent session erases memory of prior goals, user preferences, and task-specific instructions. This forces users to repeatedly 're-teach' the model from scratch across sessions, wasting time and potentially losing important accumulated context. Current implementations lack mechanisms for cross-session memory persistence."

  - name: "Context Verbosity vs Abstraction Trade-off"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:56-58)"
    quote: "Currently, context is either too verbose to be reusable, or too abstract to support concrete continuation and extension"
    description: "A failure mode where context management falls into two extremes: (1) too verbose - context is so detailed it becomes unreusable due to length and complexity, or (2) too abstract - high-level summaries remove fine-grained details, weakening the agent's ability to ground its actions in specific prior thoughts. Neither extreme supports effective continuation of work."

  - name: "Truncation-Based Context Loss"
    chunk_ref: "04-GCC-2508.00031 (Chunk 1:50-53)"
    quote: "The most straightforward is to truncate older context once the token limit is reached. While simple, this risks discarding important historical details—especially problematic when the agent needs to revisit earlier decisions"
    description: "Simple context truncation when token limits are reached risks discarding important historical details. This is especially problematic when agents need to revisit earlier decisions or maintain consistency across multi-step plans. The truncation approach fails to preserve the reasoning chain needed for complex, long-horizon tasks."
