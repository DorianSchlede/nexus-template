  # ACE Framework Implementation Patterns (Paper 01)

  - name: "Three-Role Agentic Architecture (Generator-Reflector-Curator)"
    chunk_ref: "01-ACE-2510.04618 (Chunk 1:214-218)"
    quote: "ACE introduces a structured division of labor across three roles: the Generator, which produces reasoning trajectories; the Reflector, which distills concrete insights"
    description: "Implementation of modular workflow with three specialized components. Generator produces reasoning trajectories for queries. Reflector critiques traces to extract lessons with optional multi-iteration refinement. Curator synthesizes lessons into compact delta entries merged deterministically via non-LLM logic."
