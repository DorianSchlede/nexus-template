patterns:
  - name: "SagaLLM Transaction Support with Independent Validation"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:56-62)"
    quote: "addressing these challenges requires comprehensive solutions such as the SagaLLM framework providing transaction support, independent validation procedures"
    description: "SagaLLM framework provides transaction support and independent validation as a complement to basic orchestration frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, and CAMEL which lack atomicity guarantees. This represents a dependency relationship where robust multi-agent systems require external transaction management patterns when using frameworks with insufficient built-in validation."

  - name: "CodeAct Python Interpreter Integration"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:61-62)"
    quote: "approaches like CodeAct integrating Python interpreters with LLM agents to enable code action execution and dynamic revision capabilities"
    description: "CodeAct complements LLM agent reasoning by adding execution capabilities through Python interpreter integration. This pattern relates to dynamic revision patterns where agents can execute and verify their outputs, creating a dependency between reasoning patterns and execution verification patterns."

  - name: "Orchestrated vs Autonomous Handover Patterns"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:82-87)"
    quote: "orchestrated behavior follows global control-flow patterns with activity selection dependent on previous activities...autonomous behavior operates through local control-flow and handover patterns"
    description: "AgentSimulator distinguishes between orchestrated behavior (global control-flow with centralized handover) and autonomous behavior (local control-flow with agent-specific handover patterns). These are alternative patterns - systems choose one paradigm based on whether they prioritize global coherence or agent autonomy."

  - name: "Context Management Failure Cascading with Hallucination"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:46-53)"
    quote: "Context handling failures compound these challenges as agents struggle with long-term context maintenance...LLM hallucinations can distract agentic systems, with poor recovery leading to goal deviation"
    description: "Context handling failures and hallucination patterns are causally linked - context failures compound hallucination risks which cascade into goal deviation. This represents a failure chain pattern where multiple failure modes interact and amplify each other in multi-agent setups."

  - name: "Transaction Integrity with Compensation Mechanisms"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 7:38-44)"

  - name: "Context Engineering Component Synergy and Interference"
    chunk_ref: "02-ContextSurvey-2507.13334 (Chunk 8:60-65)"
    quote: "Compositional understanding of context engineering systems demands formal models describing how individual components interact, interfere, and synergize within integrated architectures"
    description: "Context engineering components can exhibit both synergistic effects and interference patterns when integrated. This meta-pattern describes how multiple patterns may enhance or degrade overall effectiveness when combined, requiring formal models to predict coordination outcomes."
