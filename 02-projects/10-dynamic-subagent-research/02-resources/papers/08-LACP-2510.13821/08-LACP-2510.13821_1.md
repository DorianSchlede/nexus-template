**Abstract**


This position paper argues that **the field of LLM agents requires a unified,**
**telecom-inspired communication protocol to ensure safety, interoperability,**
**and scalability, especially within the context of Next Generation (NextG)**
**networks** . Current ad-hoc communication methods are creating a fragmented
ecosystem, reminiscent of the early "protocol wars" in networking, which stifles
innovation and poses significant risks. Drawing inspiration from the layered,
standardized protocols that underpin modern telecommunications, we propose the
LLM-Agent Communication Protocol (LACP). LACP establishes a three-layer
architecture designed to ensure semantic clarity in communication, transactional
integrity for complex tasks, and robust, built-in security. In this position paper, we
argue that adopting a principled, universal protocol is not merely beneficial but
essential for realizing the potential of distributed AI. Such a standard is critical for
ensuring that multi-agent systems can operate safely and reliably in the complex,
real-time applications envisioned for 6G and beyond.


**1** **Introduction**


The rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is poised to reshape industries ranging
from autonomous systems to scientific discovery [Guo et al., 2024, Fan et al., 2025, Wu et al., 2025].
As these agents gain increasingly sophisticated capabilities, their ability to collaborate on complex,
multi-step tasks becomes a critical enabler for real-world deployment. Yet, the current ecosystem
of inter-agent communication remains a patchwork of proprietary, purpose-built protocols. This
fragmentation creates a persistent **communication chasm** —hindering interoperability, compromising
security, and impeding reproducible scientific progress [Yang et al., 2025].


Figure 1(a) illustrates the detrimental effects of this ad-hoc landscape: ambiguous semantics, security
vulnerabilities, and unreliable information exchange frequently culminate in task failures. In contrast,
Figure 1(b) envisions a standardized framework, **LLM-Agent Communication Protocol** (LACP),
that delivers clarity, security, and transactional reliability, enabling robust agent communication.


The situation is reminiscent of the “protocol wars” of the 1970s–1990s, where a lack of standardization
hindered the growth of computer networking until the widespread adoption of TCP/IP [Tanenbaum,
2003, Leiner et al., 2009]. The historical lesson is unambiguous: without a common communication
substrate, the transformative potential of distributed systems remains unrealized.


Motivated by the success of standardization in telecommunications, we propose **LACP**, a telecominspired communication protocol for LLM agents. We argue that, for deployment in high-stakes
environments such as NextG networks, a unified, secure, and extensible protocol is not merely
advantageous—it is essential.

Figure 1: **LLM Agent Communication: From Ad-Hoc Chaos to LACP Clarity.**
_(a) Without LACP:_ Fragmentation, ambiguity, and failure. Ad-hoc protocols lack authentication and
semantic alignment, leading to disrupted workflows, miscommunication, and unauthorized operations.
Malformed or incomplete messages escalate coordination costs and risk system inconsistency.
_(b) With LACP:_ Structured, secure, and transactional. Every message is **authenticated**, semantically
grounded in a clear **target**, and executed as part of an **atomic transaction** . This ensures end-to-end
integrity, minimizes ambiguity, and enables reliable collaboration in safety-critical contexts.

agent communication.

**2** **The Problem: A Fragmented LLM-Agent Communication Landscape**


The current ecosystem of LLM agent communication is characterized by a variety of protocols, each
designed to address specific interoperability tiers or deployment contexts. While protocols such
as OpenAI’s Function Calling [OpenAI, 2023], LangChain’s Agent Protocol [LangChain, 2024],
Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) [Anthropic, 2024], ACP [BM BeeAI, 2024], ANP [ANP
Contributors, 2024], Agora [Marro et al., 2024], and Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) [Google, 2025]
have advanced agent capabilities [Ehtesham et al., 2025], their diversity introduces systemic risks
and hinders progress (summarized in Table 1). This fragmentation leads to three critical deficiencies:


**Crippling Interoperability Gaps:** The absence of a universal standard necessitates bespoke, often
brittle, integrations between different agent systems. This not only impedes the development of
scalable, heterogeneous multi-agent systems but also complicates the rigorous benchmarking and
comparative analysis of agent performance.


**Security as an Afterthought:** Security is often not a core, mandatory component of existing protocols.
This design choice exposes systems to significant risks, including data tampering, agent spoofing, and
other adversarial attacks, which is particularly concerning for safety-critical applications in finance,
healthcare, and autonomous systems envisioned for NextG.


**Monolithic Design & Lack of Transactional Integrity:** Current approaches often tightly couple
communication logic with core agent implementation. This leads to monolithic systems that are
challenging to maintain, debug, and extend. Furthermore, the general absence of built-in support for
atomic transactions undermines the reliability of complex, multi-step operations.

These limitations pose a substantial barrier to deploying the large-scale, interconnected, and autonomous agent systems envisioned for real-time, safety-critical scenarios in emerging domains like
NextG networks.


**3** **Insights from Telecommunications Standardization**


To solve these challenges, we can draw powerful insights from the historical success of telecommunications, which transformed a similar landscape of disparate, proprietary systems into a globally
unified network. This evolution provides a clear blueprint for addressing each of the deficiencies
identified above:


To combat **limited interoperability**, the telecom industry established **consensus-driven open stan-**
**dards** through collaborative bodies like the ITU [ITU, 1865] and 3GPP [3GPP, 1998]. This prevented
vendor lock-in and guaranteed that components from different manufacturers could seamlessly
connect, a direct parallel to the needs of a heterogeneous agent ecosystem.


To remedy **inadequate security**, mature telecom protocols were built with **security by construction** .
Security was not an add-on but a fundamental, non-negotiable component at every layer. Agent
communication must adopt this same ’security-first’ principle to be viable for critical applications.


To overcome **monolithic architectures**, telecommunications relied on **layered abstractions**, famously captured in the OSI model. By separating concerns like physical transmission from logical
addressing, the model allows different parts of the stack to evolve independently. This modularity is
precisely what is needed to create maintainable and extensible multi-agent systems.


Underpinning these solutions is the "narrow waist" principle: defining a **minimal core with an**
**extensible edge** . Standards like the Internet Protocol (IP) provide a universal, simple core for
interoperability while allowing for immense innovation and complexity at the application layer. This
model proves it is possible to create a universal standard that provides stability without stifling
flexibility—the exact balance required for the future of agent communication.


**4** **LACP: A Principled Communication Framework**


The systemic deficiencies inherent to contemporary LLM-agent communication paradigms necessitate
a foundational shift toward standardization. Inspired by proven telecom engineering principles,
we introduce the LACP—a principled framework that ensures secure, reliable, and interoperable
communications within multi-agent systems. LACP is a three-layer protocol designed to address the
systemic deficiencies of current agent communication methods. It is built on the principles of layered
abstraction, security-by-design, and a minimal, extensible core.


**4.1** **Three-Layer Architecture: Separation of Concerns**


LACP’s architecture (Figure 2) implements three mutually-insulated layers, each with well-defined
interfaces that enable independent evolution while ensuring system-wide coherence:


**Semantic Layer.** This layer is responsible for conveying the _intent_ of a communication. It defines
a minimal set of universal message types (e.g., `PLAN`, `ACT`, `OBSERVE` ) that can be extended with
domain-specific content. This "narrow waist" approach ensures that all agents can understand the
basic intent of a message, while still allowing for rich, complex communication. Table 2 shows the
core message types.

Figure 2: LACP’s three-layer architecture. Independent layers enable secure, reliable communication
with clearly defined semantic intents, transactional integrity, and flexible transport mechanisms.


**Transactional Layer.** This layer ensures the reliability and integrity of communications. It provides
mechanisms for message signing, sequencing, unique transaction IDs for idempotency, and support
for atomic transactions (e.g., two-phase commit concepts). This layer is critical for ensuring that
multi-agent interactions are secure and robust, especially in safety-critical applications.


**Transport Layer.** This layer is responsible for the efficient and secure delivery of messages. It is
transport-agnostic, meaning it can operate over a variety of network protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, QUIC,
WebSockets). This allows LACP to adapt to different network environments and


Table 2: Core LACP message types (all wrapped in a JWS envelope).


**Type** **Mandatory fields** **Optional fields** **Purpose**


`PLAN` `intent_id, role, natural_language` `graph_ops` Express high-level intent
`ACT` `intent_id, tool_call, params` `deadline, cost_cap` Invoke an external tool
`OBSERVE` `intent_id, status, output` `metrics` Return results/status


**4.2** **Anticipated Impact**


The adoption of LACP, or a similar standardized protocol, would have a transformative impact on the
field of multi-agent AI:


**Enhanced Safety and Reliability:** By making security and transactional integrity core components
of the protocol, LACP provides a verifiable foundation for agent actions.


**System-Wide Interoperability:** A universal standard would allow agents from different developers
and organizations to collaborate seamlessly, fostering a richer and more capable ecosystem.


**Accelerated Scientific Progress:** A common protocol would enable reproducible experiments and
fair benchmarking, leading to faster innovation.


**A Foundation for the Agent Economy:** A trusted and standardized means of interaction is a
prerequisite for a sophisticated agent economy, where agents can discover, contract, and collaborate
on complex tasks.


**5** **Conclusion**


The field of multi-agent AI is at a critical inflection point. The current path of fragmentation is
unsustainable and will ultimately limit the potential of this transformative technology. We have drawn
a parallel to the history of telecommunications to argue that the time for standardization is now.


We have proposed LACP as a concrete example of a principled, layered, and secure communication
protocol for LLM agents. By adopting a telecom-inspired approach, we can build a future where
multi-agent systems are safe, reliable, and interoperable.


We call on the NeurIPS community, and the broader AI and networking communities, to join us
in this effort. The development of a unified agent communication protocol is a challenge that will
require collaboration between academia, industry, and open-source developers.


The window of opportunity is now, before the patterns of fragmentation become too entrenched to
overcome. The future of collaborative AI depends on it.

**A** **Experimental Validation of LACP**


To validate the practical feasibility, performance characteristics, and security guarantees of the LLM
Agent Communication Protocol (LACP), we implemented a working prototype and conducted a
series of targeted experiments. This appendix details the methodology and results of these validations.


**A.1** **Experimental Setup**


All experiments were conducted on a local machine. The LACP-compliant server endpoints were
implemented using Python 3.11 with the Flask web framework. Cryptographic operations utilized the
`python-jose` library, and high-performance JSON processing was handled by `orjson` . The clientside test harnesses were custom Python scripts using the `requests` library. For the interoperability
test, we used the `langchain` library (version 0.1.20).


**A.2** **Experiment 1: Performance and Overhead Analysis**


**Objective:** To quantify the latency and payload size overhead of LACP compared to a standard,
non-secured RESTful API communication baseline.


**Methodology:** We developed a benchmark script that sent 10,000 sequential requests to two different
server endpoints:


1. **Baseline Endpoint:** A standard Flask route accepting a JSON payload via HTTP POST.


2. **LACP Endpoint:** A route accepting a JWS-signed LACP message. It performs cryptographic signature verification before processing the payload.


We tested this across three payload sizes to simulate a range of agent interactions, using our optimized
LACP implementation (shortened keys, ECDSA signatures).


    - **Small (51 Bytes):** Simulating a simple ACK or heartbeat message.


    - **Medium (151 Bytes):** Simulating a basic tool call with a few parameters.


    - **Large (1,964 Bytes):** Simulating a complex message, such as a detailed plan for a robotic
arm with multiple steps and coordinates.


**Results:** The performance analysis reveals a clear trend: LACP’s relative overhead is inversely
proportional to the complexity and size of the agent message. The results are summarized in Table 3.


Table 3: Performance and Overhead Analysis of LACP vs. Baseline REST.


**Payload Scenario** **Baseline Size** **LACP Size** **Size Overhead (%)** **Baseline Latency** **LACP Latency** **Latency Overhead (%)**


Small (51B) 51 bytes 306 bytes +500% 0.85 ms 0.88 ms +3.5%
Medium (151B) 151 bytes 442 bytes +191% 0.86 ms 0.89 ms +3.1%
**Large (1,964B)** 1,964 bytes 2,560 bytes **+30%** 0.89 ms 0.92 ms **+2.9%**


**Discussion:** The results strongly indicate LACP’s feasibility for real-world applications. The latency
overhead is minimal across all scenarios, with an absolute increase of only **0.03ms** for large, complex
tasks. The payload size overhead, while significant for trivial messages, shrinks to a modest and
justifiable **+30%** for realistic payloads. This represents the necessary cost for verifiable, end-to-end
cryptographic security and is a reasonable trade-off for the guarantees LACP provides.


**A.3** **Experiment 2: Interoperability Demonstration**


**Objective:** To provide a concrete demonstration of LACP’s ability to enable seamless communication
between an agent built on a major framework and a framework-agnostic tool.


**Methodology:** We constructed a two-part system:


1. **LACP Tool Server:** A standalone Flask server exposing a single endpoint. This server
hosted a simple "calculator" tool and was configured to only accept and respond with valid,
signed LACP messages.
