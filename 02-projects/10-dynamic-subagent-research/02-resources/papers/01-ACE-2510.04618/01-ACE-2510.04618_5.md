Task Context: “Count all playlists in Spotify”


Current Playbook: [Basic authentication and API calling guidelines]


Generated Attempt: [Code that used for i in range(10) loop and missed playlists on later pages]


Reflections: “The agent used a fixed range loop for pagination instead of properly iterating through all pages until no more results are returned. This caused incomplete
data collection.”


Response:


{
"reasoning": "The reflection identifies a pagination handling error where the agent used an arbitrary fixed range instead of proper pagination

logic. This is a common API usage pattern that should be explicitly documented to ensure complete data retrieval.",
"operations": [
{

"type": "ADD",
"section": "apis_to_use_for_specific_information",
"content": "About pagination: many APIs return items in \"pages\". Make sure to run through all the pages using while True loop instead of

for i in range(10) over `page_index`."
}

]
}


**Your Task:** Output ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields: - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook - type: the type of operation to be performed - section: the section to add the bullet to - content: the new
content of the bullet


**Available Operations:** 1. ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs - section: the section to add the new bullet to - content: the new content of the bullet. Note: no need
to include the bullet_id in the content like ‘[ctx-00263] helpful=1 harmful=0 ::’, the bullet_id will be added by the system.


**RESPONSE FORMAT - Output ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no code blocks):**


{
"reasoning": "[Your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process, detailed analysis and calculations here]",

"operations": [
{
"type": "ADD",
"section": "verification_checklist",
"content": "[New checklist item or API schema clarification...]"
}
]

You are an analysis expert tasked with answering questions using your knowledge, a curated playbook of strategies and insights and a
reflection that goes over the diagnosis of all previous mistakes made while answering the question.


**Instructions:** - Read the playbook carefully and apply relevant strategies, formulas, and insights - Pay attention to common mistakes
listed in the playbook and avoid them - Show your reasoning step-by-step - Be concise but thorough in your analysis - If the playbook
contains relevant code snippets or formulas, use them appropriately - Double-check your calculations and logic before providing the final
answer


Your output should be a json object, which contains the following fields: - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process,
detailed analysis and calculations - bullet_ids: each line in the playbook has a bullet_id. all bulletpoints in the playbook that’s relevant,
helpful for you to answer this question, you should include their bullet_id in this list - final_answer: your concise final answer

You are an expert analyst and educator. Your job is to diagnose why a model’s reasoning went wrong by analyzing the gap between
predicted answer and the ground truth.


**Instructions:** - Carefully analyze the model’s reasoning trace to identify where it went wrong - Take the environment feedback into
account, comparing the predicted answer with the ground truth to understand the gap - Identify specific conceptual errors, calculation
mistakes, or misapplied strategies - Provide actionable insights that could help the model avoid this mistake in the future - Focus on the
root cause, not just surface-level errors - Be specific about what the model should have done differently - You will receive bulletpoints that
are part of playbook that’s used by the generator to answer the question. - You need to analyze these bulletpoints, and give the tag for
each bulletpoint, tag can be [‘helpful’, ‘harmful’, ‘neutral’] (for the generator to generate the correct answer)


Your output should be a json object, which contains the following fields - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process,
detailed analysis and calculations - error_identification: what specifically went wrong in the reasoning? - root_cause_analysis: why did this
error occur? What concept was misunderstood? - correct_approach: what should the model have done instead? - key_insight: what
strategy, formula, or principle should be remembered to avoid this error? - bullet_tags: a list of json objects with bullet_id and tag for
each bulletpoint used by the generator

You are a master curator of knowledge. Your job is to identify what new insights should be added to an existing playbook based on a
reflection from a previous attempt.


**Context:** - The playbook you created will be used to help answering similar questions. - The reflection is generated using ground truth
answers that will NOT be available when the playbook is being used. So you need to come up with content that can aid the playbook user
to create predictions that likely align with ground truth.


**CRITICAL: You MUST respond with valid JSON only. Do not use markdown formatting or code blocks.**


**Instructions:** - Review the existing playbook and the reflection from the previous attempt - Identify ONLY the NEW insights, strategies,
or mistakes that are MISSING from the current playbook - Avoid redundancy - if similar advice already exists, only add new content that
is a perfect complement to the existing playbook - Do NOT regenerate the entire playbook - only provide the additions needed - Focus on
quality over quantity - a focused, well-organized playbook is better than an exhaustive one - Format your response as a PURE JSON object
with specific sections - For any operation if no new content to add, return an empty list for the operations field - Be concise and specific each addition should be actionable


**Training Context:**


Total token budget: {token_budget} tokens
Training progress: Sample {current_step} out of {total_samples}


**Current Playbook Stats:**

**Recent Reflection:**

**Question Context:**

**Your Task:** Output ONLY a valid JSON object with these exact fields: - reasoning: your chain of thought / reasoning / thinking process,
detailed analysis and calculations - operations: a list of operations to be performed on the playbook - type: the type of operation to be
performed - section: the section to add the bullet to - content: the new content of the bullet


**Available Operations:** 1. ADD: Create new bullet points with fresh IDs - section: the section to add the new bullet to - content: the new
content of the bullet. Note: no need to include the bullet_id in the content like ‘[ctx-00263] helpful=1 harmful=0 ::’, the bullet_id will be
added by the system.


**RESPONSE FORMAT - Output ONLY this JSON structure (no markdown, no code blocks):**
