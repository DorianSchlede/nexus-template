## Quick Reference

| Sample Size | Confidence Level | Anwendung |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **5 Interviews** | Minimum Viable | Erste Hypothesen testen |
| **10 Interviews** | Pattern Recognition | Tiefe für Customer Development |
| **15-20 Interviews** | 60% haben ICP-Klarheit | Most researchers see main patterns |
| **25-30 Interviews** | Hohe Confidence | Sample error becomes small |
| **50+ pro Segment** | Deep Segmentation | When breaking down by size/industry |

---

## Key Insight

> "Your goal is to make money, not to publish peer-reviewed academic research. If you choose respondents correctly, 10 interviews will give more depth than 50 random ones."

**Quality > Quantity**: Well-designed, well-recruited interviews matter more than volume.

---

## Saturation Indicators

You've reached saturation when:

- ✅ Same patterns appear repeatedly
- ✅ Few surprising new insights
- ✅ Interviewees confirm what you already know
- ✅ You can predict answers before they're given
- ✅ New interviews add refinement, not new themes

**Typical Saturation Point**: Interview 14-16 for homogeneous groups

---

## By Research Goal

### For ICP Hypothesis Testing
- **Minimum**: 5 interviews
- **Recommended**: 10-15 interviews
- **Goal**: Validate or invalidate initial assumptions

### For Pattern Recognition
- **Minimum**: 10 interviews
- **Recommended**: 15-25 interviews
- **Goal**: Identify recurring themes and behaviors

### For Quantitative Confidence
- **Minimum**: 25 interviews
- **Recommended**: 30+ interviews
- **Goal**: Statistical significance, generalizable insights

### For Segmentation
- **Per Segment**: 50 interviews minimum
- **Example**: 3 company sizes = 150 total interviews
- **Goal**: Compare patterns across segments

## Who to Interview

| Gruppe | Warum wichtig | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Best Customers** | >12 Monate dabei, überdurchschnittlicher Spend | High |
| **Recent Purchasers** | <6 Monate, frische Erinnerung an decision process | High |
| **Churned Customers** | Goldmine für "was ging schief" | High |
| **Lost Deals** | Warum haben sie nicht gekauft? | Medium |
| **Cold Prospects** | Ehrliches Feedback von Unbekannten | Medium |

### Selection Criteria

**Best Customers** should have:
- Been with you >12 months
- Spent more than average
- High engagement and adoption
- Strong product-market fit signals

**Churned Customers** are valuable because:
- Unfiltered honesty about what went wrong
- Identify failure patterns
- Reveal Anti-ICP characteristics

## Validation Thresholds

### When to Trust Patterns

| Observation | Trust Level |
|-------------|-------------|
| Appears in 1-2 interviews | Anecdote - needs validation |
| Appears in 3-5 interviews | Emerging pattern - keep watching |
| Appears in 6-10 interviews | Strong pattern - likely valid |
| Appears in 10+ interviews | Confirmed pattern - act on it |

### When to Update ICP

| Milestone | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 5 interviews | Review initial hypothesis |
| 10 interviews | First ICP draft update |
| 15 interviews | Scoring rubric refinement |
| 20 interviews | Persona validation |
| 25-30 interviews | ICP v1.0 finalization |

---

## Research Design Tips

### Structured vs Unstructured

**Structured approach** (hypothesis-first):
- Start with ICP hypothesis
- Design questions to validate/invalidate
- 60% capture main elements by interview 20

**Unstructured approach** (exploratory):
- Open-ended discovery
- Let themes emerge
- Need 40-50 interviews for same clarity

**Recommendation**: Use structured approach for efficiency

### Interview Quality Checklist

- [ ] Right persona (matches ICP hypothesis)
- [ ] Recent experience (ideally <6 months)
- [ ] Decision-maker or strong influencer
- [ ] Adequate time (30-45 min minimum)
- [ ] Good recording quality
- [ ] Documented immediately after

---

## Quantitative Validation

After qualitative insights, validate with surveys:

| Survey Type | Sample Size | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Customer Survey | 200-300 | Validate patterns at scale |
| Market Survey | 400+ | Generalize to broader market |
| Segment Survey | 100+ per segment | Compare segments |

**Note**: Surveys confirm what you found in interviews. They don't replace qualitative depth.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too Few Interviews
- 3 interviews ≠ validation
- Risk: Building on outliers

### ❌ Wrong Interviewees
- Random selection instead of targeted
- Talking to users when you need buyers

### ❌ No Saturation Check
- Stopping at arbitrary number
- Missing emerging patterns

### ❌ Over-Indexing on Recent
- Last 3 interviews feel most important
- Weight all interviews equally

### ❌ Skipping Churned Customers
- Only talking to happy customers
- Missing critical failure patterns
