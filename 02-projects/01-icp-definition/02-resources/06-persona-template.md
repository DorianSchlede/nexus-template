## ICP vs Persona Distinction

| Aspect | ICP | Persona |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Level** | Company | Individual |
| **Defines** | Which companies to target | Who to talk to at those companies |
| **Attributes** | Firmographics, technographics | Role, goals, pains, behavior |
| **Usage** | Account selection | Messaging, content, sales approach |

**Key Insight**: "If you can't describe your ICP without mentioning personas, you haven't defined it properly." - They're complementary but distinct.

## Common Persona Mistakes

### ❌ B2C-Style Personas
"John enjoys yoga, drives a Kia, and has 2.5 kids"
→ Not actionable for B2B sales

### ❌ Too Generic
"Marketing Manager who wants to grow pipeline"
→ Doesn't differentiate or guide action

### ❌ Too Many Personas
10+ personas = unfocused messaging
→ Start with 3-5 core personas

### ❌ Assumptions Without Data
Based on what you think, not interviews
→ Validate with real customer conversations
