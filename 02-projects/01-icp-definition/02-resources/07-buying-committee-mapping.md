## The Modern B2B Buying Committee

**Average Size**: 6-10 stakeholders (sometimes 13+ for enterprise deals)

## Multi-Threading Strategy

### Engagement by Stage

```
EARLY (TOFU):     Champion + User + Tech Validator
                  Focus: Problem validation, initial demo

MID (MOFU):       Tech Validator (deep dive) + Economic Buyer (business case)
                  Focus: Technical proof, ROI discussion

LATE (BOFU):      Economic Buyer (approval) + Procurement (contracts)
                  Focus: Final approval, contract negotiation
```

### Threading Tactics

| Tactic | How to Execute |
|--------|---------------|
| **Multi-threaded Outreach** | Contact 3-5 personas simultaneously |
| **Champion Enablement** | Arm champion to sell internally |
| **Cross-functional Demos** | Include multiple personas in calls |
| **Stakeholder Mapping** | Ask champion to map the committee |
| **Divide and Conquer** | Tailor content for each persona |

---

## Persona Content Matrix

| Persona | Content Type | Key Message |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Champion** | Case studies, ROI calculators | "Here's how to pitch this internally" |
| **Economic Buyer** | Executive summary, competitor analysis | "Lower risk, faster payback" |
| **User** | Product demos, tutorials, trials | "Your daily work, simplified" |
| **Tech Validator** | Security docs, API specs, architecture | "Secure, scalable, integrates with X" |
| **Procurement** | Standard contracts, DPA, SLA | "We've done this before" |

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Single-Threading
Only talking to one person = deal at risk when they leave or get overruled

### ❌ Ignoring Users
They don't sign checks but kill deals through non-adoption

### ❌ Late Technical Engagement
Security/IT blockers discovered at contract stage = months of delay

### ❌ Generic Messaging
Same pitch for CFO and end-user = neither convinced

### ❌ Forgetting the Champion
Not enabling them to sell internally = lost momentum
