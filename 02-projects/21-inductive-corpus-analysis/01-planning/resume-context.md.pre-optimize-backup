# Resume Context

## Current State
- Phase: COMPLETE
- Papers analyzed: 6 (UFO, Multi-Agent, Agentic RAG, SciAgents, OCEL/Event KG, GoT)
- Raw extractions: 6 parallel agents
- Synthesis: Complete

## Key Decisions Made
- **NO theoretical priming** - extracted only what authors say
- Used author terminology, not canonical terms
- Quote-first approach
- Captured contradictions between papers

## Completed Work
- [x] Created project structure
- [x] Defined unprimed extraction prompts
- [x] Ran 6 parallel extraction agents on raw paper chunks
- [x] Generated inductive synthesis report

## Key Findings
- Agent-Action-Context triad appears across AI papers (not from UDWO)
- Event-Object correlation appears across process papers
- Static vs Dynamic dichotomy is universal
- Papers DON'T converge on entity definitions (incompatible formalisms)
- "Thought" as first-class entity (GoT) - novel finding
- Entity-local ordering preferred over global (OCEL, Event KG)
- Autonomy-Alignment tension is central design concern (Multi-Agent)

## Outputs Generated
- `04-outputs/emergent_entities.yaml` - Initial entity extraction
- `04-outputs/inductive_synthesis.md` - Final synthesis report

# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
