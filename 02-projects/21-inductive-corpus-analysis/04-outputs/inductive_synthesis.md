## 2. Emergent Relationship Patterns

### 2.1 Common Relationship Verbs

| Relationship | Papers | Examples |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **decomposes-into** | 3/6 | Goal → Task, Task → Subtask, Problem → Subproblems |
| **is-part-of** | 2/6 | Component → Whole (UFO), Thought → Graph (GoT) |
| **inheres-in** | 1/6 | Moment → Bearer (UFO) |
| **correlated-to** | 2/6 | Event → Entity (OCEL, Event KG) |
| **directly-follows** | 2/6 | Event → Event per entity (OCEL, Event KG) |
| **delegates-to** | 2/6 | Agent → Agent (Multi-Agent, SciAgents) |
| **retrieves-from** | 2/6 | Agent → Knowledge source (Agentic RAG, SciAgents) |
| **transforms** | 2/6 | Operation → Thought (GoT), Action → State (Multi-Agent) |

### 2.2 Emergent Triadic Patterns

Multiple papers independently describe three-part structures:

| Source | Triad | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| UFO | Substantial - Moment - Perdurant | Independent entity + dependent property + temporal occurrence |
| PROV-O (via OCEL) | Agent - Activity - Entity | Actor + what it does + what's affected |
| Multi-Agent Taxonomy | Agent - Task - Context | Actor + work unit + resources |
| Agentic RAG | Retrieval - Augmentation - Generation | Get info + process it + produce output |
| GoT | Thought - Transformation - Evaluation | Unit + operation + scoring |

## 3. Emergent Dichotomies

These oppositions appear across multiple papers independently:

### 3.1 Universal Dichotomies (3+ papers)

| Dichotomy | Papers | Author Terms |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Static vs Dynamic** | 4/6 | UFO: Rigid/Anti-rigid; OCEL: Static/Dynamic attributes; Agentic RAG: Static/Dynamic workflows; GoT: GoO/GRS |
| **Single vs Multiple** | 4/6 | OCEL: Single-case/Multi-object; Agentic RAG: Single-agent/Multi-agent; GoT: Chain/Tree/Graph; Multi-Agent: Single/Network |
| **Independent vs Dependent** | 3/6 | UFO: Substantial/Moment; Multi-Agent: Agent/Context; Event KG: Entity/Correlation |

### 3.2 Domain-Specific Dichotomies

| Paper | Dichotomy | Significance |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| UFO | Endurant/Perdurant | Fundamental persistence distinction |
| UFO | Phase/Role | Intrinsic vs relational contingent classification |
| Multi-Agent | Autonomy/Alignment | Central system design tension |
| Agentic RAG | Sparse/Dense Retrieval | Lexical vs semantic matching |
| OCEL | E2O/O2O | Event-object vs object-object relationships |
| GoT | Latency/Volume | Hops to solution vs contributing thoughts |

## 4. Emergent Problem Patterns

### 4.1 Problems Appearing in Multiple Papers

| Problem | Papers | Author Statements |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Scaling/Scalability** | 4/6 | Agentic RAG: "scalability and latency issues"; GoT: "costs much higher"; Event KG: "cannot partition entities"; Multi-Agent: "complex tasks" |
| **Consistency/Coherence** | 3/6 | Multi-Agent: "hallucination"; Agentic RAG: "hallucinated responses"; GoT: "LLMs unable to sort consistently" |
| **Context Integration** | 3/6 | Agentic RAG: "contextual integration failure"; Multi-Agent: "prompt-driven collaboration robustness"; OCEL: "flattening leads to misleading results" |

### 4.2 Domain-Specific Problems

**Foundational Ontology (UFO)**:
- No complete theory of constitution
- Transitivity failures for parthood
- No explicit definition of function
- Single time-slice formalization limitation

**Multi-Agent Systems**:
- Balance between autonomy and alignment
- Non-terminating activities (infinite loops)
- Dead-end terminations
- Intertwined dependencies complexity

**RAG/Retrieval**:
- Static training data reliance
- Multi-step reasoning limitation
- Lack of contextual awareness in naive approaches

**Process Mining (OCEL/Event KG)**:
- No unique case identifier in multi-entity data
- Convergence (false ordering) and divergence (false duplication)
- Discovered models are wrong from false directly-follows

**LLM Reasoning (GoT)**:
- Rigid tree structure limits reasoning
- No aggregation in prior approaches
- Cost-quality tradeoff

## 5. Emergent Workflow Patterns

### 5.1 Decomposition Patterns

| Pattern | Source | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Divide & Conquer** | Multi-Agent, SciAgents | Break goal into tasks, assign to specialists |
| **Graph Decomposition** | GoT | Task → subtasks that LLM can solve with single prompt |
| **Hierarchical Delegation** | Agentic RAG, Multi-Agent | Top-tier agents delegate to subordinates |

### 5.2 Coordination Patterns

| Pattern | Source | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Sequential** | Multi-Agent (strict finite processes), Agentic RAG (prompt chaining) | Predefined action sequences |
| **Dialogue Cycles** | Multi-Agent | Alternating delegate-execute feedback loops |
| **Parallel** | Agentic RAG (sectioning/voting), GoT (generation) | Independent concurrent processes |
| **Orchestrator-Worker** | Agentic RAG, Multi-Agent | Central controller assigns to specialists |

### 5.3 Refinement Patterns

| Pattern | Source | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Reflection** | Agentic RAG | Iterative self-evaluation and output refinement |
| **Refining Transformation** | GoT | Loop edge indicating iterated thought |
| **Corrective RAG** | Agentic RAG | Self-correct retrieval through relevance evaluation |
| **Aggregation** | GoT | Combine multiple thoughts into new one |

## 6. What the Corpus DOESN'T Say

These concepts from prior primed extractions have **weak or no direct support** in raw paper text:

| Concept | Prior Claim | Actual Corpus Support |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| "8-entity hypothesis" | Pre-defined framework | Not a finding - was the search target |
| "Unified metamodel" | Convergent target | Papers use incompatible formalisms |
| "Rule" as entity | UDWO entity | Only Multi-Agent mentions "rules and mechanisms" |
| "Constraint" | UDWO entity | Not prominently defined by authors |

---

## 7. Key Insights from Unprimed Analysis

### 7.1 What Actually Converges

1. **Agent-Action-Context triad** appears across AI/LLM papers (Multi-Agent, Agentic RAG, SciAgents)
2. **Event-Object correlation** appears across process papers (OCEL, Event KG)
3. **Static vs Dynamic** dichotomy is universal
4. **Decomposition** as problem-solving strategy is universal

### 7.2 What Doesn't Converge

1. **Foundational vs Application ontologies** use incompatible categories
   - UFO has Endurant/Perdurant/Moment/Relator
   - Multi-Agent has Agent/Task/Action/Context
   - No direct mapping between them

2. **Event definitions vary**
   - UFO: Modally fragile perdurant (philosophical)
   - OCEL: Atomic unit with timestamp (practical)
   - Event KG: Record with activity and timestamp (data)

3. **Agent definitions vary**
   - UFO: Not explicitly defined
   - Multi-Agent: System component with role, memory, resources
   - Agentic RAG: Autonomous AI with LLM backbone

### 7.3 Surprising Findings

1. **"Thought" as first-class entity** - GoT introduces "thought" as the atomic unit, not "event" or "task"

2. **Volume metric** - GoT proposes counting "predecessor thoughts" as quality measure, not just path length

3. **Entity-local ordering** - Event KG and OCEL both emphasize that directly-follows should be per-entity, not global

4. **Autonomy-Alignment tension** - Multi-Agent taxonomy makes this the central design concern, not entity types

5. **Relator as aggregation** - UFO's relator is "aggregation of qua individuals" - a compositional definition

---

## 8. Recommendations for Future Work

Based on what the corpus actually says:

1. **Don't force convergence** - The papers have different purposes and formalisms
2. **Respect domain boundaries** - Foundational ontology ≠ Agent architecture ≠ Process mining
3. **Use author terminology** - "Thought" (GoT), "Action" (Multi-Agent), "Event" (OCEL) mean different things
4. **Focus on patterns** - Decomposition, delegation, refinement appear across domains
5. **Acknowledge gaps** - Authors explicitly state limitations; don't paper over them
