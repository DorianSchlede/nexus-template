## Approach Change

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Goal | Validate 8-entity hypothesis | Discover emergent patterns |
| Method | Hypothesis testing | Grounded theory |
| Output | Validation report | Novel synthesis |
| Bias Risk | Confirmation | None (open discovery) |

## Phase 1: Preparation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Create v2 briefing with discovery orientation
- [x] Create v2 extraction guide with new fields
- [x] Create v2 synthesis approach document
- [x] Create v2 resume file
- [x] Create v2 steps file

**Key Files:**
- `02-resources/_briefing_v2.md`
- `02-resources/_extraction_guide_v2.md`
- `02-resources/_synthesis_approach_v2.md`

## Phase 3: Pattern Collection ⏳ PENDING

Collect raw patterns from v2 extractions:

- [ ] Aggregate all `ontological_primitives`
- [ ] Aggregate all `structural_patterns`
- [ ] Aggregate all `novel_concepts`
- [ ] Aggregate all `gaps_and_tensions`

**Output**: Raw pattern inventory

---

## Phase 4: Cluster Analysis ⏳ PENDING

Group patterns WITHOUT predefined categories:

- [ ] Cluster similar primitives
- [ ] Identify pattern families
- [ ] Map concept genealogies
- [ ] Note outliers

**Output**: Emergent clusters

---

## Phase 5: Divergence Mapping ⏳ PENDING

Map where frameworks agree/disagree:

- [ ] Universal agreements
- [ ] Majority patterns
- [ ] Contested territory
- [ ] Orphan concepts

**Output**: `_divergence_map.yaml`

---

## Phase 6: Gap Synthesis ⏳ PENDING

Identify what's missing:

- [ ] Universal gaps
- [ ] Partial gaps
- [ ] Emerging gaps (AI era)

**Output**: `_gap_analysis.yaml`

---

## Phase 7: Novel Synthesis ⏳ PENDING

Generate new insights:

- [ ] Synthesize emergent framework (if warranted)
- [ ] Identify novel combinations
- [ ] Propose contributions

**Output**: `_synthesis_opportunities.md`

---

## Phase 8: Final Report ⏳ PENDING

Write discovery synthesis:

- [ ] Methodology
- [ ] Emergent taxonomy
- [ ] Pattern catalog
- [ ] Divergence map
- [ ] Gap analysis
- [ ] Surprises section
- [ ] Synthesis opportunities
- [ ] Grounded conclusions

**Output**: `_synthesis_report_v2.md`

## Success Criteria

v2 synthesis is successful if:

1. Categories emerged from data (not predefined)
2. Surprises were documented
3. Gaps were identified
4. Disagreements preserved
5. Novel synthesis proposed
6. No confirmation bias evident
