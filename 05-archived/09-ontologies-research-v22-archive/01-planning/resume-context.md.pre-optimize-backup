# Project 9: Ontologies Research - Resume Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: V2 SYNTHESIS IN PROGRESS
**Approach**: DISCOVERY (grounded theory, not hypothesis validation)

---

## CURRENT STATE

### Phase 2 Complete: All 22 Papers Re-Analyzed
- All 22 papers have `index_v2.md` files with 12-field discovery extraction
- Extraction used V2 schema (different from standard pipeline schema)
- Fields: ontological_primitives, structural_patterns, novel_concepts, semantic_commitments, boundary_definitions, temporal_modeling, agency_spectrum, knowledge_representation, emergence_indicators, integration_surfaces, gaps_and_tensions, empirical_grounding

### Phase 3-4 Complete: Pattern Collection & Clustering
- Created `04-outputs/_emergent_taxonomy.yaml` with clustered primitives
- Identified 8 emergent primitive clusters (not predefined categories)

### IMPORTANT: V2 Uses Discovery Schema

The V2 approach uses a **different extraction schema** than the standard research pipeline:
- Standard pipeline: `index.md` with `chunk_index.fields_found`
- V2 Discovery: `index_v2.md` with 12 open-ended fields for grounded theory

**The synthesize-research-project skill expects Schema 2.3 format with chunk_index.**
**V2 extractions use open discovery format - manual synthesis required.**

---

## NEXT ACTION: Manual V2 Synthesis

Since V2 uses discovery-oriented extraction (not standard schema), complete Phases 5-8 manually:

### Phase 5: Divergence Mapping
Create `04-outputs/_divergence_map.yaml`:
- Universal agreements (all frameworks agree)
- Majority patterns (most agree)
- Contested territory (frameworks disagree)
- Orphan concepts (appear once)

### Phase 6: Gap Synthesis
Create `04-outputs/_gap_analysis.yaml`:
- Universal gaps (all frameworks miss)
- Partial gaps (some address, some don't)
- Emerging gaps (AI era introduces new needs)

### Phase 7: Novel Synthesis
Create `04-outputs/_synthesis_opportunities.md`:
- Novel framework possibilities
- Integration opportunities
- Research directions

### Phase 8: Final Report
Create `04-outputs/_synthesis_report_v2.md`:
- Methodology (discovery approach, not validation)
- Emergent taxonomy
- Pattern catalog
- Divergence map
- Gap analysis
- Surprises section
- Synthesis opportunities
- Grounded conclusions

## V2 EMERGENT FINDINGS (from _emergent_taxonomy.yaml)

### 8 Emergent Primitive Clusters
1. **Foundational Entities**: Endurant, Perdurant, Moment/Trope, Relator, Disposition (6/22 papers)
2. **Agent Concepts**: Agent, Potential Actor, Role, Organizational Unit (12/22 papers)
3. **Activity Concepts**: Activity, Event, Task, Process, Activity Specification (18/22 papers)
4. **Entity Concepts**: Entity, Object, Resource, Knowledge Graph (20/22 papers)
5. **Knowledge Concepts**: Triple, Embedding, Thought, Memory, Logic Rule (8/22 papers)
6. **Temporal Concepts**: Time Point/Interval, Timestamp, Temporal Part, State of Affairs (10/22 papers)
7. **Teleological Concepts**: Goal, Purpose, Intended Purpose, Plan (6/22 papers)
8. **Structural Concepts**: FlowElement, SequenceFlow, Gateway, GoO, Vertex/Edge (8/22 papers)

### Confirmed Patterns
1. **Agent-Activity-Entity Triad**: 18/22 papers (near-universal with variations)
2. **Specification-Instance Separation**: 6/22 papers
3. **Hierarchical Containment**: 8/22 papers

### Surprising Absences
- **Rule/Governance**: Expected strong category, found weak (3/22)
- **AI Agent Identity**: No paper addresses agent persistence/identity
- **Error/Exception Ontology**: Mentioned but not formalized

### Key Tensions Preserved
- Type-based vs Role-based Agency (UFO vs Enterprise Ontology)
- Events-as-Data vs Events-as-Control (OCEL vs BBO)
- Symbolic vs Neural Knowledge (Logic vs Embeddings)
- Case-Centric vs Object-Centric (Traditional PM vs OCEL)
