  # CLUSTER 1: Foundational Ontological Primitives
  # Papers: UFO, DOLCE, BFO, Enterprise Ontology, UFO Story
  foundational_entities:
    description: "Core metaphysical building blocks from foundational ontologies"
    frequency: 6/22 papers
    members:
      - term: "Endurant"
        sources: ["UFO", "UFO Story", "DOLCE"]
        definition: "Entity wholly present whenever it exists"
        variations:
          - "Continuant" (BFO)
          - "Entity" (Enterprise Ontology)

      - term: "Perdurant/Occurrent"
        sources: ["UFO", "UFO Story", "DOLCE", "BFO"]
        definition: "Entity that unfolds through temporal parts"
        variations:
          - "Process" (BFO)
          - "Activity" (PROV-O, Enterprise Ontology)

      - term: "Moment/Trope"
        sources: ["UFO", "UFO Story"]
        definition: "Particularized property instance"
        unique_to: "UFO family"
        novelty: "Enables reified relationships (Relators)"

      - term: "Relator"
        sources: ["UFO", "UFO Story"]
        definition: "Moment that mediates entities, making relationships first-class"
        contrast: "Enterprise Ontology does NOT reify relationships"

      - term: "Disposition"
        sources: ["UFO", "BFO"]
        definition: "Connection between endurants and events via causation"
        role: "Enables causal laws as foundation of transition rules"

    observation: |
      NOT universal - only foundational ontology papers use these distinctions.
      Applied papers (OCEL, KG-Agent, Agentic RAG) operate at shallower level.

  # CLUSTER 2: Agent-Related Primitives
  # Papers: PROV-O, Enterprise Ontology, Multi-Agent, Agentic RAG, UFO-C
  agent_concepts:
    description: "Primitives for modeling agency and actors"
    frequency: 12/22 papers
    members:
      - term: "Agent"
        sources: ["PROV-O", "UFO", "Multi-Agent", "Agentic RAG", "KG-Agent"]
        variations:
          type_based:
            - "PROV-O Agent: bears responsibility for activity"
            - "UFO Agent: intentional entity with beliefs/desires/goals"
            - "Agentic RAG Agent: LLM + Memory + Planning + Tools"
          role_based:
            - "Enterprise Ontology Actor: Entity playing Actor Role"
            - "BBO Agent: HumanResource OR SoftwareResource"
        tension: "Type-based (is-a) vs Role-based (plays-a) agency models"

      - term: "Potential Actor"
        sources: ["Enterprise Ontology"]
        definition: "Entity that CAN play Actor Role (Person, OU, Machine)"
        unique_aspect: "Modal agency - capability vs actualization"

      - term: "Role"
        sources: ["UFO", "Enterprise Ontology", "BBO", "Multi-Agent"]
        variations:
          - "UFO Role: anti-rigid type, context-dependent"
          - "Enterprise Role: way entity participates in relationship"
          - "BBO Role: authorization level for activity execution"

      - term: "Organizational Unit"
        sources: ["Enterprise Ontology"]
        definition: "Entity for managing activity, can act collectively"
        unique_aspect: "Organizational agency - groups as Potential Actors"
        gap: "NOT supported in most other frameworks"

    surprise: |
      ROLE-BASED AGENCY (Enterprise Ontology 1998) predates most agent ontologies.
      Agency as contextual role-playing, not inherent property.

    gap: |
      AI/LLM Agents not well-theorized. Agentic RAG treats Agent as "composite"
      (LLM + Memory + Planning + Tools) rather than primitive.

  # CLUSTER 3: Activity/Process Primitives
  # Papers: PROV-O, BFO, OCEL, BPMN/BBO, Process Mining papers

    universal_pattern: |
      Something that ACTS exists across ALL frameworks.
      Called Activity, Event, Task, Process, Occurrent, Action.
      The triad of [Actor]-[Action]-[Affected] appears in 18+ papers.

  # CLUSTER 4: Entity/Object Primitives

    members:
      - term: "Entity"
        sources: ["PROV-O", "Enterprise Ontology"]
        definition_variants:
          - "PROV-O: thing with fixed aspects, used/generated by activities"
          - "Enterprise: fundamental thing in domain"

          - "Enterprise: used or consumed in activity"
          - "RPA: input for process activity"
        tension: "Broad (all things used) vs Narrow (just agents) definitions"

      - term: "Knowledge Graph"
        sources: ["KG Survey", "KG-Agent", "SciAgents"]
        definition: "Set of fact triples {<e, r, e'>}"
        unique_aspect: "Structural definition without ontological commitment"

    observation: |
      The "thing affected" concept is universal but under-theorized.
      PROV-O Entity and OCEL Object represent similar concepts.
      No agreement on entity identity criteria.

  # CLUSTER 5: Knowledge/Information Primitives
  # Papers: KG papers, GoT, Agentic RAG

        unique: "Symbolic, discrete primitive contrasting with embeddings"

    tension: |
      SYMBOLIC (rules, ontologies) vs NEURAL (embeddings, LLMs).
      KG Survey documents extensive attempts to bridge this gap.
      No consensus on integration approach.

  # CLUSTER 6: Temporal Primitives
  # Papers: UFO-B, OCEL, BFO, Enterprise Ontology
  temporal_concepts:
    description: "Primitives for modeling time and change"

        sources: ["Enterprise Ontology", "UFO"]
        definition: "Configuration of relationships at a time"

    gap: |
      Temporal modeling is SPARSE in AI agent papers.
      KG Survey, Multi-Agent, Agentic RAG have no temporal primitives.
      OCEL is exception with rich temporal event semantics.

  # CLUSTER 7: Goal/Purpose Primitives

        variations:
          - "Enterprise: Activity Specification + Intended Purpose"
          - "Multi-Agent: Agentic pattern for task decomposition"

    gap: |
      SPARSE in AI papers. Agentic RAG has "tasks" but no formal goals.
      Multi-Agent notes "agents have 'tasks' and 'roles' but no intentions."
      BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) mentioned but not formalized.

  # CLUSTER 8: Structural/Flow Primitives

      - term: "Vertex/Edge"
        sources: ["GoT", "KG papers"]
        definition: "Graph primitives for representing dependencies"

    observation: |
      Process-oriented papers have rich structural primitives.
      AI agent papers (Multi-Agent, Agentic RAG) have workflow PATTERNS
      but not formal structural primitives.

non_emergent_categories:
  description: "Categories that did NOT emerge universally"

  rule_constraint:
    expected: true
    actual_frequency: 3/22 papers
    observation: |
      Expected a "Rule" category but found sparse coverage.
      BBO has Expressions (not first-class).
      Enterprise Ontology has Authority (not general rules).
      Most papers have NO rule/constraint primitive.
    gap_significance: HIGH

  data:
    expected: true
    actual_frequency: 4/22 papers
    observation: |
      Expected a distinct "Data" category but often subsumed.
      BBO has DataResource as Resource subtype.
      OCEL treats data as object attributes.
      Most papers don't distinguish data as primitive.

  quality_attribute:
    expected: false
    actual_frequency: 4/22 papers
    observation: |
      UFO's Quality/Quale concepts are UFO-specific.
      Most applied papers don't model intrinsic qualities.

  social_commitment:
    expected: false
    actual_frequency: 2/22 papers
    observation: |
      UFO-C and Enterprise Ontology mention commitments/authority.
      NOT a common primitive in agent/process papers.

synthesis_observations:

  confirmed_patterns:
    - pattern: "Agent-Activity-Entity Triad"
      frequency: 18/22 papers
      note: |
        This pattern is NEAR-UNIVERSAL but with significant variation.
        Sometimes 3 elements, sometimes 4+ elements (OCEL Object-Centric).
        Names vary: Agent/Actor, Activity/Event/Task, Entity/Object/Resource.

    - pattern: "Specification-Instance Separation"
      frequency: 6/22 papers
      note: |
        Enterprise Ontology's Activity Specification pattern
        echoed in Process Specification, Plan, and even GoO (meta-level plans).

    - pattern: "Hierarchical Containment"
      frequency: 8/22 papers
      note: |
        Processes contain SubProcesses contain Tasks (BBO).
        Organizations contain Units contain Persons (Enterprise).
        Recursive containment is common structural pattern.

  surprising_absences:
    - category: "Rule/Governance"
      observation: |
        Expected strong Rule category. Found weak coverage.
        No paper has formal rule ontology integrated.

    - category: "AI Agent Identity"
      observation: |
        No paper addresses: What makes an AI agent the same agent?
        Forking, cloning, context-switching not theorized.

    - category: "Error/Exception"
      observation: |
        Process papers mention failures but no ontology of errors.
        LLM papers mention hallucination but no formal treatment.

  tensions_preserved:
    - name: "Type-based vs Role-based Agency"
      papers: ["UFO vs Enterprise Ontology"]
      description: |
        Is Agent a TYPE of entity (UFO) or a ROLE an entity plays (Enterprise)?
        No resolution - both approaches have merit.

    - name: "Events-as-Data vs Events-as-Control"
      papers: ["OCEL vs BBO"]
      description: |
        OCEL: events are data entities with timestamps, queryable history.
        BBO: events are control flow elements affecting process execution.
        Fundamentally different perspectives on "what is an event?"

    - name: "Symbolic vs Neural Knowledge"
      papers: ["KG Survey"]
      description: |
        Logic rules (discrete, interpretable) vs Embeddings (continuous, learned).
        Survey documents many integration attempts, no consensus.

    - name: "Case-Centric vs Object-Centric"
      papers: ["OCEL vs Traditional PM"]
      description: |
        Traditional: events belong to ONE case.
        OCEL: events relate to MULTIPLE objects.
        Paradigm shift in process mining.
