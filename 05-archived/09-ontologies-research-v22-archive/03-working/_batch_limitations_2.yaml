patterns:
  - name: "Completeness Measurement Intractability"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:109-111)"
    quote: "Measuring completeness directly is non-trivial as it requires knowledge of a hypothetical ideal knowledge graph"
    description: "Knowledge graph completeness cannot be directly measured because it requires knowing all elements that should 'ideally' be present - a hypothetical ideal knowledge graph that is fundamentally unknowable. This creates an inherent limitation in assessing coverage quality."

  - name: "Semantic Accuracy Assessment Challenge"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:50-65)"
    quote: "Assessing the level of semantic inaccuracies is challenging. While one option is to apply manual verification..."
    description: "Determining whether data values correctly represent real-world phenomena is difficult to automate. Options include manual verification (costly, unscalable) or checking against multiple sources (requires trusted external sources). Neither approach fully solves the semantic accuracy problem."

  - name: "Timeliness Decay"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:68-72)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph may be semantically accurate now, but may quickly become inaccurate (outdated) if no procedures..."
    description: "Knowledge graphs face temporal validity limitations - data that is accurate at one point becomes stale over time. Without continuous update mechanisms, graphs naturally decay in accuracy, creating an ongoing maintenance burden."

  - name: "Representativeness Bias"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:120-149)"
    quote: "Examples of data biases include geographic biases that under-represent entities/relations from certain parts of the world"
    description: "Knowledge graphs inherently contain biases - geographic, linguistic, social - that under-represent certain populations or domains. These biases stem from data sources, curator demographics, and schema design choices. Unrecognized biases can compound over time and adversely affect applications."

  - name: "Schema Bias Propagation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:138-140)"
    quote: "schema biases may result from high-level definitions extracted from biased data, semantic definitions that do not cover uncommon cases"
    description: "Schema-level biases can emerge from biased data extraction and fail to cover edge cases or uncommon scenarios. These structural limitations propagate to all instances in the knowledge graph."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Inherent Incompleteness"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:295)"
    quote: "Knowledge graphs are characterised by incompleteness"
    description: "Incompleteness is a defining characteristic of knowledge graphs, not merely an implementation flaw. This fundamental limitation motivates knowledge graph completion techniques but can never be fully overcome."

  - name: "Identity Link Prediction Efficiency"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:380-382)"
    quote: "A major challenge in this setting is efficiency, where a pairwise matching would require O(n^2) comparisons"
    description: "Entity matching/deduplication faces quadratic scaling challenges. While blocking and windowing techniques help, fundamental computational complexity limits remain for identity link prediction at scale."

  - name: "Inconsistency Repair Complexity"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:532-545)"
    quote: "With respect to correcting a knowledge graph, however, detecting inconsistencies is not enough: techniques are also required to repair"
    description: "Detecting inconsistencies is insufficient; repairing them is non-trivial because one edge can participate in many inconsistencies, one inconsistency can involve many edges, and entailment chains must be considered when removing edges."

  - name: "Graph Pattern Query Intractability"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:124-126)"
    quote: "the problem of evaluating such queries is known to be intractable"
    description: "Evaluating complex graph pattern queries is computationally intractable in the general case. This creates fundamental limits on query expressiveness vs. performance trade-offs for knowledge graph access protocols."

  - name: "SPARQL Endpoint Reliability"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:128-130)"
    quote: "public services offering such a protocol (most often supporting SPARQL queries) have been found to often exhibit downtimes, timeouts, partial results, slow performance"
    description: "Public SPARQL endpoints suffer from reliability issues including downtimes, timeouts, and incomplete results. This practical limitation affects the usability of complex query interfaces for knowledge graphs."

  - name: "Access Protocol Bandwidth vs. Computation Trade-off"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:83-88)"
    quote: "the server may often need to transfer irrelevant intermediate results to the client...This issue is further aggravated if the client does not have access to statistics"
    description: "Edge pattern protocols force trade-offs between server computation and bandwidth. Without access to knowledge graph statistics, clients cannot optimize join ordering, leading to inefficient query execution."

  - name: "Encryption Performance Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:299-305)"
    quote: "A key limitation of this approach, however, is that it requires attempting to decrypt all edges to find all possible solutions"
    description: "Fine-grained encryption of knowledge graph edges creates performance limitations because finding query solutions may require attempting to decrypt all edges, negating the efficiency benefits of graph indexing."

  - name: "Privacy-Information Trade-off"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:409-417)"
    quote: "These approaches require information loss for stronger guarantees of privacy; which to choose is thus heavily application dependent"
    description: "Privacy protection mechanisms (k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy) inherently require information loss. Stronger privacy guarantees demand more information loss, creating unavoidable trade-offs."

  - name: "Scalability Challenge"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:19-21)"
    quote: "more general challenges for knowledge graphs include scalability, particularly for deductive and inductive reasoning"
    description: "Scalability remains a general challenge for knowledge graphs, especially for reasoning tasks. Both deductive (ontological) and inductive (machine learning) methods face scaling limitations as graphs grow."

  - name: "Quality Dimension Generality"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:21-23)"
    quote: "quality, not only in terms of data, but also the models induced from knowledge graphs"
    description: "Quality concerns extend beyond data quality to include the quality of models derived from knowledge graphs. Inductive models trained on biased or incomplete graphs may perpetuate or amplify those limitations."

  - name: "Diversity Management"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:23-24)"
    quote: "diversity, such as managing contextual or multi-modal data"
    description: "Managing diverse data types - contextual, temporal, streaming, multi-modal - presents ongoing challenges. Knowledge graph representations may not adequately capture all relevant data modalities."

  - name: "Dynamicity Handling"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:24-25)"
    quote: "dynamicity, considering temporal or streaming data"
    description: "Handling dynamic, temporal, and streaming data remains challenging. Static knowledge graph representations struggle to capture evolving real-world phenomena."

  - name: "Usability for Adoption"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:25-26)"
    quote: "and finally usability, which is key to increasing adoption"
    description: "Usability barriers limit knowledge graph adoption. Complex query languages, ontology engineering requirements, and lack of user-friendly tools create barriers for non-expert users."

  - name: "Unsolved Challenges"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 9:26-31)"
    quote: "Though techniques are continuously being proposed to address precisely these challenges, they are unlikely to ever be completely solved"
    description: "Core knowledge graph challenges (scalability, quality, diversity, dynamicity, usability) are acknowledged as unlikely to ever be completely solved. They represent ongoing dimensions along which techniques will continue to mature rather than problems with final solutions."

  - name: "Description Logic Entailment Undecidability"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:410-422)"
    quote: "Unfortunately, the problem of deciding entailment for knowledge bases expressed in the DL composed of the unrestricted use of all of the axioms...is undecidable"
    description: "Full Description Logic with unrestricted axiom use leads to undecidable entailment. This forces practical systems to restrict feature combinations, limiting expressivity to maintain computability. Trade-offs between expressivity and tractability are inherent."

  - name: "GNN Limited Expressivity"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:516-522)"
    quote: "GNNs (and indeed GPFs) relying solely on the neighbourhood of each node have limited expressivity in terms of their ability to distinguish nodes and graphs"
    description: "Graph Neural Networks operating only on local neighborhoods have fundamental expressivity limitations - they cannot distinguish certain structurally distinct nodes or graphs. This limits their classification and reasoning capabilities without extensions like global shared vectors."
