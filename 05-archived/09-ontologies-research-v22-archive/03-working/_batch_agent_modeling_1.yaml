patterns:
  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs_1.md
  - name: "Knowledge Graph as Agent Substrate"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:67-75)"
    quote: "Employing a graph-based abstraction of knowledge has numerous benefits... edges capture the (potentially cyclical) relations between the entities"
    description: "Knowledge graphs provide a graph-based abstraction where edges capture relations between entities. This pattern is foundational for agent modeling as it provides the substrate upon which agents can reason about entity relationships, navigate knowledge, and make decisions based on structured data."

  - name: "Entity-Centric Node Representation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-142)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest"
    description: "Nodes in knowledge graphs represent entities of interest in the real world. For agent modeling, this establishes how agents perceive and interact with world entities - each node is a potential object of agent attention, reasoning, or action."

  - name: "Edge-Based Relational Semantics"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:141-143)"
    quote: "whose edges represent relations between these entities. The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model"
    description: "Edges represent relations between entities, conforming to a graph-based data model. This pattern enables agents to traverse and reason about relationships, understand how entities connect, and infer new knowledge through relational pathways."

  - name: "Schema-Flexible Agent Knowledge"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:84-87)"
    quote: "Graphs allow maintainers to postpone the definition of a schema, allowing the data and its scope to evolve in a more flexible manner"
    description: "Unlike rigid relational models, graphs allow schema-flexible knowledge accumulation. For agent modeling, this means agents can adapt to evolving knowledge without requiring predefined structures, supporting dynamic learning and knowledge integration."

  - name: "Ontology-Based Semantic Grounding"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:93-98)"
    quote: "Standard knowledge representation formalisms such as ontologies and rules can be employed to define and reason about the semantics of the terms"
    description: "Ontologies and rules define semantics for graph terms. This pattern grounds agent reasoning in formal semantics - agents can use ontological definitions to understand entity types, valid relationships, and constraints that govern their actions."

  - name: "Deductive Knowledge Entailment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:156-162)"
    quote: "Deductive methods can then be used to entail and accumulate further knowledge (e.g., Santiago is a city). Additional knowledge can also be extracted"
    description: "Deductive methods enable agents to infer new knowledge from existing facts and rules. This pattern is essential for agent reasoning - agents can derive conclusions, make inferences, and expand their knowledge base through logical deduction."

  - name: "Inductive Knowledge Extraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:160-162)"
    quote: "Additional knowledge based on simple or quantified statements can also be extracted from and accumulated by the knowledge graph using inductive methods"
    description: "Inductive methods allow extraction of knowledge patterns from the graph itself. For agent modeling, this enables agents to learn from experience, identify patterns, and generalize from specific instances to broader principles."

  - name: "Identity Resolution for Agents"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:168-172)"
    quote: "identity denotes which nodes in the graph (or in external sources) refer to the same real-world entity"
    description: "Identity management determines when different graph nodes refer to the same entity. Agents must resolve identity to avoid duplicate reasoning, merge knowledge about the same entity from different sources, and maintain coherent world models."

  - name: "Context-Aware Knowledge Validity"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:172-174)"
    quote: "context may indicate a specific setting in which some unit of knowledge is held true"
    description: "Context determines when knowledge is valid. For agent modeling, this is crucial - agents must understand that knowledge may be context-dependent, temporally bounded, or conditionally true, affecting how they apply knowledge in decision-making."

  - name: "Open vs Enterprise Knowledge Graphs"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:189-206)"
    quote: "Open knowledge graphs are published online, making their content accessible for the public good... Enterprise knowledge graphs are typically internal to a company"
    description: "Distinction between open and enterprise knowledge graphs. Agents may need to operate across both types, understanding that open graphs offer broad knowledge while enterprise graphs contain domain-specific, potentially proprietary information."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs_15.md
  - name: "Graph Neural Network for Agent Learning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:385-395)"
    quote: "A recursive graph neural network (RecGNN) is a pair of functions... Agg computes a new feature vector for a node, given its previous feature vector"
    description: "Recursive graph neural networks aggregate neighborhood information to compute node representations. For agent modeling, GNNs can enable agents to learn representations of entities based on their graph context, supporting reasoning about entity properties based on relational structure."

  - name: "Neighborhood Aggregation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:398-402)"
    quote: "The function Agg computes a new feature vector for a node, given its previous feature vector and the feature vectors of the nodes and edges forming its neighbourhood"
    description: "GNNs aggregate information from node neighborhoods. This pattern is applicable to agent modeling where agents can perceive entities in terms of their relational context - understanding an entity through its connections to other entities."

  - name: "Hypothesis Induction for Agent Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:537-548)"
    quote: "The task of hypothesis induction assumes a particular graph entailment relation... Given background knowledge in the form of a knowledge graph"
    description: "Hypothesis induction enables generating new hypotheses from background knowledge. For agent modeling, this supports agent learning and theory formation - agents can propose explanations for observations and test them against known facts."

  # From 03-PROV-AGENT_Unified_Provenance_for_AI_Agents_1.md
  - name: "AI Agent as PROV Agent Extension"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:200-204)"
    quote: "the W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process)"
    description: "PROV-O defines Agent as a core class alongside Entity and Activity. This pattern grounds AI agents in established provenance ontology - agents are responsible for activities that consume and produce entities, providing a formal basis for agent accountability and tracing."

  - name: "AIAgent as PROV Agent Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-284)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow"
    description: "AIAgent is modeled as a subclass of W3C PROV Agent. This pattern enables representing AI agents within standard provenance frameworks while adding agent-specific properties like tool use, prompt handling, and LLM invocations."

  - name: "Agent Tool Execution Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-291)"
    quote: "an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool) and each tool may be informed by (PROV wasInformedBy) one or many AIModelInvocations"
    description: "AI agents execute tools that are informed by model invocations. This pattern captures the structure of agentic workflows where agents use tools, invoke AI models with prompts, and receive responses that guide their actions."

  - name: "Prompt-Response Attribution"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:288-292)"
    quote: "Each AIModelInvocation uses a Prompt and a specific AIModel... and generates a ResponseData object, which is attributedTo the corresponding agent"
    description: "Model invocations consume prompts and generate responses attributed to agents. This pattern supports agent accountability - responses can be traced back through prompts and model invocations to understand how agents arrived at decisions."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Workflow Representation"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:280-284)"
    quote: "This modeling is not constrained to single-agent scenarios. Multi-agentic workflows, with other AI agents, each with their own tools and reasoning paths, can be instantiated"
    description: "The model supports multi-agent workflows with multiple agents having independent tools and reasoning. This pattern enables representing collaborative or parallel agent behaviors, agent-to-agent interactions, and complex multi-agent orchestration scenarios."
