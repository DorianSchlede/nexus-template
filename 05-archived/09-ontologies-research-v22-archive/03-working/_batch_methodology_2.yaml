patterns:
  - name: "Four-Category Definition Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:124-254)"
    quote: "We can determine four general categories of definitions... Category I... Category II... Category III... Category IV"
    description: "The paper employs a systematic definitional methodology for knowledge graphs, categorizing existing definitions into four distinct categories: (1) simple graph-based definitions where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships; (2) knowledge base-structured definitions; (3) technical criteria-based definitions with specific compliance requirements; and (4) extensional definitions based on examples. This hybrid top-down/bottom-up approach synthesizes existing definitions to establish a comprehensive taxonomy. This methodology is relevant for ontology engineering as it demonstrates how to ground new definitions in existing work while identifying gaps."

  - name: "Technical Criteria Definition Approach"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:175-231)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph mainly describes real world entities and their interrelations, organized in a graph; defines possible classes and relations"
    description: "Paulheim's criteria-based methodology lists four technical characteristics: (1) describes real-world entities and interrelations in graph form; (2) defines possible classes and relations in a schema; (3) allows interrelating arbitrary entities; (4) covers various topical domains. This top-down approach sets exclusion criteria (ruling out ontologies without instances, word sense graphs, domain-specific graphs). Relevant for UDWO metamodel grounding as it shows how to operationalize abstract ontological concepts into testable criteria."

  - name: "Reasoning-Centric Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:196-211)"
    quote: "A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge"
    description: "Ehrlinger and Woss propose a methodology distinguishing knowledge graphs from ontologies by the provision of reasoning capabilities. This top-down definitional approach emphasizes inference as the distinguishing feature. The methodology separates the knowledge acquisition phase from the reasoning phase, creating a process-oriented view of knowledge graphs. Relevant for AI agent integration patterns where reasoning over ontological structures is key."

  - name: "Three-Component Semi-Structured Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:213-231)"
    quote: "a semi-structured data model characterized by three components: (i) a ground extensional component... (ii) an intensional component... (iii) a derived extensional component"
    description: "Bellomarini et al. propose a rigorous technical methodology with three components: (1) ground extensional component (schema and data); (2) intensional component (inference rules); (3) derived extensional component (results of reasoning). This hybrid approach bridges bottom-up data modeling with top-down logical inference. Highly relevant for the 8-entity hypothesis as it provides a template for separating structural definitions from derivation rules."

  - name: "Enterprise Consensus Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:256-284)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph describes objects of interest and connections between them... many practical implementations impose constraints on the links in knowledge graphs by defining a schema or ontology"
    description: "Noy et al. represent industry consensus from eBay, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. The methodology balances minimal definitional requirements with acknowledgment that schemas/ontologies 'usually' play a key role. This bottom-up, empirically-grounded approach derives from industrial practice rather than theoretical first principles. Demonstrates how practical enterprise ontology adoption differs from academic rigor."

  - name: "Formal Graph Data Model Definitions"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:292-376)"
    quote: "A directed edge-labelled graph is a tuple G = (V,E,L), where V is a set of nodes, L is a set of edge labels, and E is a set of edges"
    description: "The paper provides formal mathematical definitions for multiple graph data models: directed edge-labelled graphs, heterogeneous graphs, property graphs, and graph datasets. This top-down formal methodology uses set-theoretic definitions with precise notation. Each model is defined as a tuple with explicit components and constraints. Essential foundation for understanding how different graph models support different ontological commitments."

  - name: "Graph Pattern Query Formalization"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:449-527)"
    quote: "We define a directed edge-labelled graph pattern as a tuple Q = (V,E,L), where V is a set of node terms, L is a set of edge terms, and E is a set of edges"
    description: "The methodology formalizes graph patterns using variables (Var) disjoint from constants (Con), enabling query semantics. The approach extends data graph definitions to pattern graphs by replacing constants with terms (Term = Con union Var). This top-down formalization supports both homomorphism-based and isomorphism-based query semantics. Relevant for ontology-guided LLM reasoning where pattern matching over knowledge graphs is required."

  - name: "Shapes Schema Validation Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:721-907)"
    quote: "A shapes schema is defined as a tuple S := (Phi, S, lambda) where Phi is a set of shapes, S is a set of shape labels, and lambda: S -> Phi is a total function"
    description: "The methodology defines validating schemas through shapes with formal evaluation semantics. Shapes include constraints like node membership, boolean conditions, conjunctions, negations, and cardinality restrictions on edges. The shapes map function assigns binary satisfaction values to node-shape pairs. This top-down formalism provides the theoretical foundation for SHACL-like validation. Directly relevant for constraining generative AI outputs via ontological schemas."

  - name: "Quotient Graph Emergent Schema"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:42-99)"
    quote: "Emergent schemata are often based on the notion of a quotient graph... A quotient graph can merge multiple nodes into one node, where the merged node preserves the edges"
    description: "The methodology for emergent schemas uses quotient graphs defined via equivalence relations on nodes. The approach supports simulation and bisimulation relations to characterize structural preservation. This is a bottom-up approach that derives schema from data topology rather than imposing it top-down. The methodology demonstrates how schemas can emerge from data patterns, relevant for process mining ontologies like OCEL."

  - name: "Annotation Domain Semi-Ring Formalization"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:113-172)"
    quote: "An annotation domain is defined as an idempotent, commutative semi-ring D = <A, +, x, bottom, top>"
    description: "The methodology formalizes contextual annotations using algebraic structures (idempotent commutative semi-rings). This enables well-defined reasoning and querying over annotation domains (temporal, probabilistic, etc.). The approach extends directed edge-labelled graphs to include annotation values on edges. Top-down mathematical formalism that supports multi-valued or contextual knowledge representation."

  - name: "Graph Interpretation and Model Semantics"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:177-261)"
    quote: "A graph interpretation I is defined as a pair I := (Gamma, dot-I) where Gamma is a domain graph and dot-I is a partial mapping from constants to terms"
    description: "The methodology defines formal semantics through interpretations that map graph constants to domain elements. The approach distinguishes UNA (Unique Name Assumption) via injective mappings. Models are interpretations that satisfy graphs under semantic conditions. Entailment is defined as model inclusion. This top-down logical formalism provides the theoretical foundation for reasoning over knowledge graphs."

  - name: "Rule-Based Inference Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:269-325)"
    quote: "A rule is a pair R = (B,H) such that B and H are graph patterns and Var(H) is subset of B. We call B the body of the rule while we call H the head"
    description: "The methodology formalizes rules for graph inference with body-head structure. Rule application computes mappings from body to graph, then substitutes variables in head. The least model is computed via fixpoint iteration. Rules can be correct (entails only valid conclusions) and complete (entails all valid conclusions) for semantic conditions. Directly relevant for ontology-guided agent reasoning and planning strategies."

  - name: "Description Logic Knowledge Base Structure"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:335-424)"
    quote: "A DL knowledge base K is defined as a tuple (A, T, R), where A is the A-Box: a set of assertional axioms; T is the T-Box: a set of class axioms; and R is the R-Box: a set of relation axioms"
    description: "The methodology structures Description Logic knowledge bases into three components: A-Box (assertions about individuals), T-Box (terminological class axioms), R-Box (role/relation axioms). DL interpretations map individuals, classes, and relations to domain elements. This is the formal foundation for OWL ontologies. Highly relevant for the 8-entity hypothesis validation as DL provides the formal grounding for entity definitions."

  - name: "Graph Parallel Framework Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:479-756)"
    quote: "A graph parallel framework (GPF) is a triple of functions G := (Msg, Agg, End) such that Msg defines what message must be passed from a node to a neighboring node"
    description: "The methodology formalizes graph-parallel computation via three functions: Msg (message passing between nodes), Agg (aggregation of incoming messages), End (termination condition). Input is directed vector-labelled graphs. Computation proceeds iteratively until fixpoint. This bottom-up algorithmic approach enables scalable analytics like PageRank over knowledge graphs. Relevant for AI agent systems that need to process large-scale graph data."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Embedding Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:759-895)"
    quote: "Given a directed edge-labelled graph G = (V,E,L), a knowledge graph embedding of G is a pair of mappings (epsilon, rho) such that epsilon: V -> T and rho: L -> T"
    description: "The methodology defines embeddings as mappings from nodes and edge labels to tensors. Plausibility scoring functions evaluate edge likelihood. Training maximizes plausibility of positive edges while minimizing negative. Various models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, etc.) instantiate different scoring functions. Full expressiveness is a formal guarantee. This hybrid approach bridges symbolic graphs with subsymbolic representations, enabling LLM integration patterns."

  - name: "Graph Neural Network Recursive Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:378-447)"
    quote: "A recursive graph neural network (RecGNN) is a pair of functions R := (Agg, Out), where Agg computes a new feature vector for a node given its previous feature vector and the feature vectors of the nodes and edges forming its neighbourhood"
    description: "The methodology formalizes recursive GNNs with aggregation and output functions. Aggregation iterates until fixpoint, then output transforms final vectors. Non-recursive GNNs use layer-specific aggregation functions. Convolutional GNNs apply convolutional operators. This bottom-up inductive approach learns representations from graph structure. Relevant for ontology-guided LLM reasoning where neural approaches complement symbolic methods."

  - name: "Hypothesis Mining Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:530-682)"
    quote: "Given a knowledge graph G, a set of negative edges E-, a scoring function sigma, and a threshold min_sigma, the goal of hypothesis mining is to identify a set of hypotheses"
    description: "The methodology formalizes inductive learning over graphs with support and confidence scoring. Distinguishes positive support (edges entailed by hypothesis) from negative support (false edges entailed). Confidence ratio balances coverage vs. precision. CWA, OWA, and PCA assumptions determine negative edge generation. Discrete mining uses refinement operators; differentiable mining uses gradient descent. Hybrid top-down/bottom-up approach for rule and axiom discovery."

  - name: "W3C PROV Extension Methodology for Agentic Workflows"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:17-41)"
    quote: "we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions"
    description: "PROV-AGENT extends the W3C PROV standard specifically for agentic workflows. The methodology integrates three core PROV classes (Agent, Entity, Activity) with MCP concepts (tools, prompts, resources). This top-down extension approach adds AI-specific artifacts (AIAgent, AgentTool, AIModelInvocation, Prompt, ResponseData) while maintaining PROV compatibility. Directly addresses how ontologies enable AI agents, LLM reasoning, and multi-agent orchestration."

  - name: "Unified Provenance Graph Methodology"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:249-313)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT is a provenance model for representing AI agent interactions, model invocations, and their relationships to non-agentic tasks and data in agentic workflows"
    description: "The methodology models agent interactions as first-class workflow components alongside traditional tasks. Uses subclass relationships (AIAgent subclassOf Agent, AgentTool subclassOf Activity). Standard PROV relationships (used, wasGeneratedBy, wasAssociatedWith, wasInformedBy) connect agent artifacts. Supports multi-agent scenarios and modality-agnostic foundation models. This hybrid approach bridges traditional workflow provenance with AI agent traceability, directly relevant for the UDWO metamodel's agent modeling requirements."
