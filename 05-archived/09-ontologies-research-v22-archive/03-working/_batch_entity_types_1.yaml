patterns:
  - name: "Entity-Relation Graph Core Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-142)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations"
    description: "The foundational entity type in knowledge graphs is the 'Entity' - nodes represent entities of interest and edges represent relations between entities. This defines the core duality of entity-relation modeling in knowledge graphs."

  - name: "Node-Edge Directed Graph Entities"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:404-408)"
    quote: "A directed edge-labelled graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of directed labelled edges between those nodes"
    description: "Knowledge graphs model entities as nodes and relations as directed labelled edges. The entity types are determined by the domain - in the tourism example, entity types include events, venues, cities, date-times."

  - name: "Class-Based Entity Types (Type Hierarchy)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:106-118)"
    quote: "We may thus decide to define classes to denote these groupings, such as Event, City, etc. In fact, Figure 1 already illustrates three low-level classes - Open Market, Food Market, Drinks Festival"
    description: "Entity types are formalized through classes that denote groupings of similar nodes. Classes form hierarchies where children are subclasses of parents, enabling type inference (e.g., if EID15 is type Food Festival, infer it is also type Festival and type Event)."

  - name: "Event Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:135-152)"
    quote: "Festival, Food Festival, Drinks Festival, Music Festival... Event, Periodic Market, Open Market, Closed Market"
    description: "Event is a core entity type with sub-types including Festival (Food Festival, Drinks Festival, Music Festival) and Periodic Market (Open Market, Closed Market). Events have properties like name, venue, start date, end date."

  - name: "Place Entity Type (City, Venue)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:160-174)"
    quote: "we may define the domain of connects to is a class Place... we may define that the range of city is a class City, inferring that Arica type City"
    description: "Place is a core entity type encompassing geographic entities. Subtypes include City and Venue. Place entities can have properties like latitude, longitude, and relations like flight, bus, city."

  - name: "Property Entity Type (Relations)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:120-125)"
    quote: "we may also wish to define the semantics of edge labels, aka properties. Returning to Figure 1, we may consider that the properties city and venue are sub-properties of a more general property location"
    description: "Properties (edge labels) form their own type hierarchy. Properties like city and venue are sub-properties of location. Properties like bus and flight are sub-properties of connects_to. Properties have domain and range constraints."

  - name: "Semantic Schema Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:176-191)"
    quote: "A prominent standard for defining a semantic schema for (RDF) graphs is the RDF Schema (RDFS) standard, which allows for defining subclasses, subproperties, domains, and ranges"
    description: "RDFS and OWL define meta-entity types for schemas: Class, Property, with features like subclass, subproperty, domain, range. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) extends these with richer semantics."

  - name: "Individual Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:473-476)"
    quote: "In Table 3, we list the main features supported by OWL for describing individuals (e.g., Santiago, EID16), sometimes distinguished from classes and properties"
    description: "Individuals are concrete instances of classes - distinct from classes (types) and properties (relations). Examples: Santiago (individual city), EID16 (individual event). Individuals can be asserted as same-as or different-from each other."

  - name: "DL Tripartite Entity Types (Individual-Class-Property)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:149-155)"
    quote: "Description Logics are based on three types of elements: individuals, such as Santiago; classes (aka concepts) such as City; and properties (aka roles) such as flight"
    description: "Description Logics formalize the foundational entity type triad: Individuals (concrete entities), Classes/Concepts (types/categories), and Properties/Roles (relations). This forms the ontological foundation for knowledge graphs."

  - name: "Assertional vs Terminological Entities (A-Box/T-Box)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:152-159)"
    quote: "Assertional axioms can be either unary class relations on individuals, such as City(Santiago), or binary property relations on individuals... class axioms (forming the Terminology Box)"
    description: "Knowledge graphs distinguish between A-Box (Assertional Box) containing instances/individuals and T-Box (Terminology Box) containing class axioms. A third R-Box (Role Box) contains property axioms."

  - name: "Endurant/Perdurant Distinction (Not Explicit)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:303-311)"
    quote: "both nodes - according to the class hierarchy of Figure 11 - are considered to be events. But what if, for example, we wish to define two pairs of start and end dates... what precisely do we mean by an event?"
    description: "The paper implicitly addresses the endurant/perdurant distinction through event modeling. Events are time-dependent entities (perdurants) that unfold over intervals, contrasting with static entities like places (endurants)."

  - name: "Agent Entity Type (Implicit)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:864-870)"
    quote: "entities (e.g., graphs, nodes, physical document) are derived from other entities, are generated and/or used by activities (e.g., extraction, authorship), and are attributed to agents (e.g., people, software, organisations)"
    description: "The PROV Data Model defines Agent as a core entity type - entities that are responsible for activities and to which other entities are attributed. Agents include people, software, and organizations."

  - name: "Activity Entity Type (PROV-O)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:864-870)"
    quote: "entities... are generated and/or used by activities (e.g., extraction, authorship)"
    description: "Activity is a core entity type in the PROV Data Model. Activities are things that occur over time, use or generate entities, and are associated with agents. Examples: extraction, authorship."

  - name: "Entity (PROV-O Generic)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:866-867)"
    quote: "entities (e.g., graphs, nodes, physical document) are derived from other entities"
    description: "In PROV-O, Entity is the most generic type - a thing with some fixed aspects that can be physical, digital, or conceptual. Entities can be derived from other entities and are used/generated by activities."

  - name: "Datatype Value Entities"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:713-730)"
    quote: "RDF utilises XML Schema Datatypes (XSD), amongst others, where a datatype node is given as a pair (l,d) where l is a lexical string... and d is an IRI denoting the datatype, such as xsd:dateTime"
    description: "Datatype values are a special entity category - literals that represent data values like strings, integers, dates. They differ from object/entity nodes as they cannot have outgoing edges (in RDF). Common types: xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:dateTime."

  - name: "Named Graph Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:583-611)"
    quote: "A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph. Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph"
    description: "Named Graphs are meta-level entities that group edges into identifiable sub-graphs. They support context, provenance tracking, and graph-level metadata. Graph names can themselves be nodes in other graphs."

  - name: "Existential/Blank Node Entities"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:793-810)"
    quote: "some graph models permit the use of existential nodes... Existential nodes are supported in RDF as blank nodes, which are also commonly used to support modelling complex elements"
    description: "Blank nodes (existential nodes) represent entities whose identity is unknown but whose existence is asserted. They enable modeling incomplete information and complex structures like RDF lists."

  - name: "Class Definition Entity Types (OWL Complex)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:658-682)"
    quote: "OWL provides a variety of features for defining novel classes by applying set operators on other classes... complement of another class, the union or intersection of a list"
    description: "OWL supports complex class definitions as entity types: Complement classes (negation), Union classes (disjunction), Intersection classes (conjunction), Enumerated classes (explicit instance lists), and Restriction classes (property constraints)."

  - name: "Restriction-Based Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:666-676)"
    quote: "by placing restrictions on a particular property p, one can define classes whose instances are all of the entities that have: some value from a given class on p; all values from a given class"
    description: "Entity types can be defined via property restrictions: SomeValuesFrom (existential), AllValuesFrom (universal), HasValue (specific value), HasSelf (reflexive), Cardinality constraints (min/max/exact counts)."

  - name: "Heterogeneous Graph Node/Edge Types"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:483-502)"
    quote: "A heterogeneous graph is a graph where each node and edge is assigned one type. Heterogeneous graphs are thus akin to del graphs with edge labels corresponding to edge types"
    description: "Heterogeneous graphs explicitly type both nodes and edges as part of the graph model itself. Node types partition nodes for tasks like machine learning. Edge types can be homogeneous (same node types) or heterogeneous (different node types)."

  - name: "Property Graph Entities (Nodes with Properties)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:548-561)"
    quote: "A property graph allows a set of property-value pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges"
    description: "Property graphs extend entity modeling by allowing nodes and edges to have property-value pairs in addition to labels. This enables richer entity representation (e.g., cities with latitude/longitude properties)."

  - name: "Quotient Graph Entity Types (Emergent Schema)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:439-457)"
    quote: "we could consider six partitions of nodes: event, name, venue, class, date-time, city. In practice, these partitions may be computed based on the class or shape of the node"
    description: "Emergent schemas derive entity types from graph structure through quotient graphs. Partitions like event, venue, city, date-time emerge from analyzing node contexts and relationships, providing data-driven entity type discovery."

  - name: "Shape-Based Entity Types (Validating Schema)"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:250-288)"
    quote: "A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes... shapes graph based on Figure 1, defining constraints on four interrelated shapes"
    description: "Shapes define entity types through structural constraints rather than class membership. Shape types (Place, Event, Venue, City) specify required properties, cardinalities, and value types. Shapes can inherit constraints from parent shapes."

  - name: "Temporal/Context Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:859-863)"
    quote: "One example is the Time Ontology, which specifies how temporal entities, intervals, time instants, etc. - and relations between them such as before, overlaps"
    description: "The Time Ontology defines specialized temporal entity types: Temporal Entity, Interval, Instant. These support temporal context modeling with relations like before, after, overlaps, enabling temporal reasoning in knowledge graphs."
