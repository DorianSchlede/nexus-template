patterns:
  - name: "Agentic Workflow Paradigm Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:51-54)"
    quote: "agentic workflows, where autonomous agents make decisions, plan tasks, and coordinate with humans and other agents"
    description: "Defines agentic workflows as a new paradigm where AI agents operate autonomously to make decisions, plan tasks, and coordinate with both humans and other agents. This represents a shift from static, deterministic workflows to dynamic, agent-driven execution patterns."

  - name: "Non-Deterministic Dynamic Workflow Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:81-84)"
    quote: "agentic workflows are non-deterministic, shaped by near real-time data, adaptive decisions, and evolving interactions"
    description: "Agentic workflows exhibit non-deterministic behavior, distinguishing them from traditional workflows with static, deterministic paths. They are shaped by real-time data, adaptive decisions, and continuously evolving interactions. They display dynamic, cyclic behavior where agent outputs inform subsequent decisions or feedback loops."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Framework Orchestration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:141-147)"
    quote: "LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, Academy, and CrewAI support multi-agent systems that interact through prompt exchanges"
    description: "Identifies key multi-agent orchestration frameworks including LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, Academy, and CrewAI. These frameworks support multi-agent systems that interact through prompt exchanges, calls to foundation models, and shared context. They implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard."

  - name: "MCP Protocol for Agent Coordination"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:145-150)"
    quote: "MCP defines core agentic AI development concepts, including tools, prompts, resources, context management, and agent-client architecture"
    description: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines core agentic AI concepts: tools, prompts, resources, context management, and agent-client architecture. Agents can communicate with external sources like knowledge bases or web pages for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to dynamically augment prompts."

  - name: "Cross-Facility Distributed Agent Execution"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:151-159)"
    quote: "managing execution across physically and logically distributed facilities that include edge devices, cloud services, and HPC systems"
    description: "Agentic workflows span a computing continuum including edge devices, cloud services, and HPC systems. Data streams in near real-time from experimental facilities to HPC systems, with AI agents interacting with this data across systems. This requires reliable data movement and coherent understanding of agent interactions."

  - name: "Agent-Workflow Integration Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:254-256)"
    quote: "provenance model for representing AI agent interactions, model invocations, and their relationships to non-agentic tasks and data in agentic workflows"
    description: "PROV-AGENT models AI agent interactions alongside traditional workflow components. It extends W3C PROV to unify agents and traditional components as first-class elements, enabling representation of both agentic and non-agentic tasks within a single workflow provenance graph."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Workflow Instantiation"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:281-284)"
    quote: "Multi-agentic workflows, with other AI agents, each with their own tools and reasoning paths, can be instantiated within the same provenance graph"
    description: "The provenance model supports multi-agent scenarios where multiple AI agents with their own tools and reasoning paths can be instantiated in the same workflow. This enables representation of collaborative or parallel agent behaviors within a workflow."

  - name: "Agent Tool Execution Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-291)"
    quote: "an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool) and each tool may be informed by one or many AIModelInvocations"
    description: "Following MCP terminology, an AI agent can be associated with multiple tool executions. Each tool execution (AgentTool) may be informed by one or many AIModelInvocations. Each invocation uses a Prompt and specific AIModel, generating a ResponseData object attributed to the agent."

  - name: "Iterative Agent Decision Loop"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:439-445)"
    quote: "the decision made for each layer informs the decision logic in the next, enabling the system to learn over the course of a print"
    description: "Describes iterative agent decision-making where each decision informs the next iteration. This creates feedback loops where agent outputs at iteration i influence iteration i+1. The pattern enables continuous learning within workflow execution but also risk of error propagation."

  - name: "Agent Context and RAG Integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:304-306)"
    quote: "data can be used by the agent as part of reasoning or planning, for example through RAG strategies to enhance prompts with relevant contextual knowledge"
    description: "Agents can consume system-level and contextual data (SchedulingData, TelemetryData) as part of reasoning or planning. RAG strategies enhance prompts with relevant contextual knowledge, enabling agents to make decisions informed by workflow context."

  - name: "Hierarchical Agent-Workflow Association"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:263-268)"
    quote: "Campaign, Workflow, and Task, modeled as subclasses of PROV Activities. Campaigns are associated with Person or Organization agents"
    description: "Hierarchical workflow structure with Campaign > Workflow > Task, all modeled as PROV Activities. Campaigns are associated with Person or Organization agents. Tasks consume and produce domain-specific data, with agentic tools integrated at the task level."

  - name: "Agent Error Propagation and Traceability"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:88-91)"
    quote: "risks are amplified in workflows where agent decisions influence other agents or downstream tasks, potentially affecting scientific conclusions"
    description: "In multi-agent workflows, risks are amplified when agent decisions influence other agents or downstream tasks. Errors can propagate through the workflow, compounding and potentially affecting scientific conclusions or operational outcomes. This necessitates provenance tracking for traceability."

  - name: "Agent Accountability Query Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:493-509)"
    quote: "Q1. Given an agent decision, what was the complete lineage until the first input data?"
    description: "Defines key provenance queries for agent accountability: (Q1) complete lineage from decision to first input, (Q2) agent decision with reasoning context, (Q3) LLM prompt/response for surprising decisions, (Q4) downstream influence of decisions, (Q5) error origin and propagation paths."

  - name: "Agent-Prompted LLM Invocation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:354-366)"
    quote: "Tool executions are often informed by one or more AIModel calls... wrapper captures the prompt, response, model metadata"
    description: "Agent tools execute by invoking LLM services (e.g., OpenAI, SambaNova). A wrapper captures prompt, response, model metadata (provider, name, temperature), and telemetry. The tool is linked to AIModelInvocation via wasInformedBy relationship, connecting tool execution to LLM reasoning."
