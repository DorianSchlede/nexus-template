- name: UFO Four-Category Ontology Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:116-117)
    quote: UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling
      notions via a set of micro-theories
  description: UFO is explicitly structured as a four-category ontology. The four
    fundamental categories are not enumerated here but represent the top-level partitioning.
    This is significant for entity_count as it establishes UFO's foundational architecture
    using exactly four top-level categories.
- name: UFO Three-Fragment Organization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:270-279)
    quote: 'UFO is organized in three main fragments: UFO-A, which is an ontology
      of endurants; UFO-B, which is an ontology of perdurants; UFO-C, which is an
      ontology of social and intentional entities'
  description: UFO is modularly organized into three fragments (UFO-A, UFO-B, UFO-C),
    each covering different ontological domains. This modular structure contributes
    to its overall entity count by separating endurants, perdurants, and social/intentional
    entities into distinct theoretical modules.
- name: UFO Endurant vs Perdurant Binary Distinction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-285)
    quote: UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between
      endurants (e.g., Mick Jagger, the Moon) and perdurants (e.g., the 2020 U.S.
      presidential election)
  description: UFO's fundamental binary distinction between endurants (entities existing
    wholly at any time) and perdurants (entities unfolding in time) represents a core
    structural choice. This 3D vs 4D ontological stance determines how entities are
    classified and counted.
- name: UFO Substantial and Moment Endurant Partition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:298-301)
    quote: UFO is an ontology based of the so-called Aristotelian Square, thus, accounting
      for both substantial individuals (or Substantials), i.e., independent entities...
      as well as particularized properties, i.e., existentially dependent entities
      or moments
  description: UFO partitions endurants into substantials (independent entities) and
    moments (existentially dependent entities). This binary partition under endurants
    doubles the entity count at the second level of the taxonomy.
- name: UFO Substantial Trichotomy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:353-361)
    quote: Quantities are maximally-topologically-self-connected... Collectives are
      entities whose parts play the same role with respect to the whole... Objects
      (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated functional
      roles
  description: 'Substantials are partitioned into three categories: Quantities, Collectives,
    and Objects (functional complexes). This trichotomy at the substantial level adds
    3 entity types to the UFO entity count.'
- name: UFO Moment Trichotomy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:302-334)
    quote: Intrinsic moments are existentially dependent on a single individual. These
      include qualities... Intrinsic moments also include modes... relator is a moment
      (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is an aggregation of qua individuals
  description: Moments are partitioned into Qualities, Modes, and Relators. Qualities
    project into value spaces, Modes include dispositions, and Relators are aggregations
    of qua individuals. This adds 3 entity types at the moment level.
- name: UFO Six Leaf Endurant Categories
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:710-712)
    quote: Let Le be the set of the leaf categories of endurants {Object, Collective,
      Quantity, Relator, Mode, Quality}
  description: 'UFO explicitly defines exactly 6 leaf categories for endurants: Object,
    Collective, Quantity, Relator, Mode, and Quality. This is a precise entity count
    for the terminal endurant taxonomy - a formalized enumeration.'

    quote: Let LT be the set of the leaf categories of the aforementioned taxonomy
      of endurant types {Kind, SubKind, Role, Phase, SemiRigidSortal, RoleMixin, PhaseMixin,
      Category, Mixin}
  description: For endurant TYPES (meta-types), UFO defines exactly 9 leaf categories
    based on rigidity and sortality meta-properties. This represents another dimension
    of entity classification with precise cardinality.
- name: UFO Fourteen Leaf Endurant Type Categories Extended
  sources:

    quote: LET = {ObjectKind, CollectiveKind, QuantityKind, SubKind, RelatorKind,
      ModeKind, QualityKind, SemiRigidSortal, Category, Phase, Mixin, Role, PhaseMixin,
      RoleMixin}
  description: The complete taxonomy of endurant types has 14 leaf categories combining
    kinds with their specializations. This represents the full entity_count for UFO's
    type system taxonomy.
- name: DBpedia Four Classification Schemata
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:478-499)
    quote: Entities within DBpedia are classified using four different schemata in
      order to address varying application requirements... These schemata include
      a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)... YAGO classification schema...
      UMBEL ontology categorisation schema, and a custom schema called the DBpedia
      ontology
  description: 'DBpedia uses exactly 4 different classification schemata to organize
    entities: SKOS, YAGO, UMBEL, and custom DBpedia ontology. This demonstrates that
    entity_count can vary based on which schema is applied, and large knowledge graphs
    support multiple concurrent classification schemes.'
- name: DBpedia Ontology Core Classes
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:498-500)
    quote: a custom schema called the DBpedia ontology with classes such as Person,
      Place, Organisation, and Work
  description: The DBpedia ontology has core entity classes including Person, Place,
    Organisation, and Work. While not exhaustive, this indicates a relatively small
    set of top-level entity types for practical knowledge graph deployment.
- name: YAGO Lightweight Extensible Ontology
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:508-509)
    quote: light-weight and extensible ontology with high quality and coverage
  description: YAGO is described as a 'light-weight' ontology, suggesting a deliberately
    constrained entity_count to balance quality with coverage. The 'extensible' nature
    indicates the entity_count is meant to grow organically rather than be fixed upfront.
- name: Enterprise Knowledge Graph Lightweight Taxonomies
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:718-721)
    quote: the ontologies used tend to be lightweight, often simple taxonomies representing
      a hierarchy of classes or concepts
  description: Enterprise knowledge graphs typically use lightweight ontologies with
    simple taxonomies. This pattern shows that practical enterprise applications favor
    lower entity_counts compared to philosophical foundational ontologies - explicitly
    stating the hierarchy is 'simple.'
- name: PROV-O 153 Classes and Object Properties Total
  sources:

    quote: A total alignment in the sense of Criterion 4 was achieved by mapping all
      153 classes and object properties in PROV-O and its extensions
  description: PROV-O and its extensions contain exactly 153 classes and object properties
    total. This is a precise entity_count for a W3C recommended provenance ontology
    including all extensions (PROV-AQ, PROV-Dictionary, PROV-Links, PROV-Inverses,
    PROV Dublin Core).
- name: PROV-O Core Triad Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:75-77)
    quote: 'PROV-O is a W3C recommended ontology used to structure data about provenance:
      information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece
      of data or thing'
  description: 'PROV-O is fundamentally organized around three core concepts: entities,
    activities, and people/agents. This Agent-Activity-Entity triad represents PROV-O''s
    minimal core entity_count of 3 for provenance modeling.'
- name: PROV-O Starting Point vs Expanded vs Qualified Terms
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:622-627)
    quote: Starting Point terms are referred to as 'a small set of classes and properties'...
      Expanded terms are subclasses and subproperties... Qualified terms are those
      used to provide 'additional attributes of the binary relations'
  description: 'PROV-O explicitly organizes terms into three tiers: Starting Point
    (small core set), Expanded (more specific subclasses), and Qualified (reification
    patterns). This tiered architecture shows how entity_count grows from a minimal
    core outward.'
- name: DOLCE Four Basic Categories
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:121-122)
    quote: the basic categories of DOLCE are endurant (aka continuant), perdurant
      (occurrent), quality, and abstract
  description: 'DOLCE has exactly 4 basic/top-level categories: endurant, perdurant,
    quality, and abstract. This represents DOLCE''s foundational entity_count at the
    highest abstraction level - a quaternary top-level structure.'
- name: DOLCE Taxonomy with Extensions
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:125)
    quote: The taxonomy of DOLCE extended with the subcategories Concept, Role, and
      Artefact
  description: 'DOLCE''s taxonomy includes extension categories: Concept, Role, and
    Artefact. This shows how the base entity_count of 4 top-level categories is extended
    with domain-specific subcategories while maintaining the foundational structure.'
- name: BFO Continuant Hierarchy - 18 Entity Types
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:66-88)
    quote: continuant, independent continuant, material entity, object, fiat object
      part, object aggregate, object boundary, site, dependent continuant...
  description: BFO 1.1 defines a comprehensive continuant hierarchy with approximately
    18 distinct entity types organized in a tree structure. This includes independent
    continuants (material entities, objects, fiat object parts, object aggregates,
    object boundaries, sites) and dependent continuants (generically dependent, specifically
    dependent - qualities, realizable entities including roles, dispositions, capabilities,
    functions). The spatial regions add another 4 types.
- name: BFO Occurrent Hierarchy - 16 Entity Types
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:92-108)
    quote: occurrent, processual entity, process, process boundary, process aggregate,
      fiat process part, spatiotemporal region, scattered spatiotemporal region...
  description: 'BFO 1.1 occurrents comprise approximately 16 entity types: processual
    entities (process, process boundary, process aggregate, fiat process part), spatiotemporal
    regions (scattered, connected, instant, interval), and temporal regions (scattered,
    connected, instant, interval). This demonstrates BFO''s comprehensive yet small
    upper-level ontology design philosophy.'
- name: BFO Small by Design - 34 Total Terms
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:280-290)
    quote: BFO is, by the standards predominant in contemporary ontology, very small,
      consisting of just 34 terms (see Figure 2), including both familiar terms such
      as 'process', 'object', 'function'
  description: BFO is deliberately designed to be very small with only 34 terms total.
    This small entity count reflects the principle that top-level ontology should
    not contain domain-specific terms like 'cell', 'death', or 'plant' - those belong
    in domain ontology modules of narrower scope. The 34 terms provide upper-level
    categories common across domain ontologies.
- name: BFO Modularity Principle for Entity Count
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:48-52)
    quote: It is deliberately designed to be very small, so that it may represent
      in a consistent fashion those upper-level categories common to domain ontologies
      developed by scientists in different fields.
  description: BFO's entity count reflects modularity and division of expertise principles.
    The small count (~34 entities) exists specifically to provide consistency across
    domain ontologies while allowing domain-specific entities to be added at lower
    levels. Entity count is purposefully minimized at the foundational level.
- name: Gene Ontology - 30,000 Terms in Three Ontologies
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:193-195)
    quote: The GO consists of three sub-ontologies, together comprehending some 30,000
      terms representing types and subtypes of biological processes, molecular functions,
      and cellular components.
  description: 'The Gene Ontology demonstrates how domain ontologies built on foundational
    ontologies can have massive entity counts (30,000 terms). This contrasts sharply
    with BFO''s 34 terms and shows the abstraction-dependency principle: foundational
    ontologies are small while domain ontologies can be very large.'
- name: BFO Bicategorial Structure - Two Fundamental Categories
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:340-342)
    quote: BFO, in contrast, is founded on a bicategorial approach which seeks to
      combine elements of both the three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives.
  description: 'At its highest level, BFO has just 2 fundamental category types: continuants
    (three-dimensional) and occurrents (four-dimensional). This bicategorial structure
    is the root of all 34 entity types, demonstrating how a minimal foundational count
    expands through principled subdivision.'
- name: Aristotle's Ontological Square - 4 Quadrants
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:447-452)
    quote: BFO accepts also the distinction between universals and particulars, it
      thus recapitulates Aristotle's ontological square
  description: 'BFO''s structure incorporates Aristotle''s 4-quadrant ontological
    square: types vs instances crossed with independent vs dependent continuants.
    This 2x2 structure provides a principled way to organize entities and explains
    why BFO has both substance/accident and universal/particular distinctions.'

      of events, Uetype is the universe of event types, Uobj is the universe of objects,
      Uotype is the universe of object types...'
  description: 'OCEL 2.0 formally defines 8 fundamental universes/entity types: events,
    event types (activities), objects, object types, attribute names, attribute values,
    timestamps, and qualifiers. This small, precise entity count enables process mining
    while maintaining formal rigor.'
- name: OCEL 2.0 Metamodel - 4 Core Entities Plus Relationships

      number of additional attributes.
  description: 'The OCEL 2.0 metamodel centers on 4 core entity types: events, objects,
    event types, and object types. Additionally, it includes E2O (event-to-object)

      Object IDs: PR1, PO1/PO2, R1/R2/R3, P1/P2'
  description: The OCEL 2.0 running example demonstrates 4 object types (Purchase
    Requisition, Purchase Order, Invoice, Payment) and 8 event types. This shows that
    OCEL entity counts vary per process domain - a procurement process has different
    entity types than manufacturing.
- name: OCEL Running Example - 8 Event Types
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:732-743)
    quote: 'Event Type: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition,
      Create Purchase Order, Change PO Quantity, Insert Invoice, Set Payment Block,
      Remove Payment Block, Insert Payment'
  description: The OCEL running example has exactly 8 event types, demonstrating how
    event type counts are process-specific. Event types correspond to activities that
    can occur, and the number reflects process complexity rather than ontological
    constraints.

      the universe of activities.'
  description: 'Traditional process mining uses 3 core universes: event identifiers,

  description: Event knowledge graphs have exactly 2 core node labels (Event, Entity)
    and 2 relationship labels (df for directly-follows, corr for correlation). This
    minimal entity type count enables representing complex multi-entity behaviors
    through graph structure rather than type proliferation.

      derived entity type (ent1, ent2). That is, we make each pair (n1, n2) ∈ R[related]
      an entity node (n1, n2)
  description: Entity counts can grow through derivation - creating composite entity
    types like (Order, Payment) from base types. This shows entity counts are not
    fixed but can expand through reification to capture interactions between entities.
- name: Activity as Entity Type
  sources:

    quote: For example, if we pick the Activity property as 'entity identifier', we
      infer entities such as Receive SO, Unpack, Scan, Store, Retrieve, Pack Shipment.
  description: Activities themselves can be treated as entity types in event knowledge
    graphs. This demonstrates that what counts as an entity type depends on analytical
    perspective - the same data can yield different entity counts depending on which

- name: Entity Count Rationale via Schema Metrics

    quote: 'SD = NH/NC. This measure describes the distribution of classes across
      different levels of the ontology class hierarchy. The SD value of BBO is low
      (less than one hypernymy link per class): it means that the ontology is deep
      (or vertical): it covers a knowledge domain (i.e., BPs) in a detailed manner.'
  description: 'The entity count of 106 is justified by the schema deepness (SD) metric.
    With SD = 0.78 (83/106),

    the ontology is characterized as "deep" or "vertical" - covering the business
    process domain in

    detail. The low SD indicates many specific leaf classes rather than broad hierarchical
    structures.

    This validates that the 106-entity count serves detailed domain coverage rather
    than being

    artificially inflated or sparse.
