- name: Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:769-778)
    quote: The main goal of knowledge graph embedding techniques is to create a dense
      representation of the graph in a continuous, low-dimensional vector space that
      can then be used for machine learning tasks
  description: Knowledge graph embeddings transform graph structures into dense vector
    representations suitable for machine learning. This enables AI systems to perform
    link prediction, entity similarity computation, and knowledge completion tasks.
    The embeddings preserve latent graph structures while reducing dimensionality
    from sparse one-hot encodings to continuous vector spaces (typically 50-1000 dimensions).
- name: Plausibility Scoring for Edge Prediction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:806-822)
    quote: a specific embedding approach defines a scoring function that accepts es
      (the entity embedding of node s), rp (the entity embedding of edge label p)
      and eo... and computes the plausibility of the edge
  description: Embedding approaches define scoring functions that compute plausibility
    scores for potential edges in knowledge graphs. This enables AI systems to assess
    edge validity, complete missing links, and validate externally extracted information.
    The scoring function maps entity and relation embeddings to numerical plausibility
    values for decision-making.
- name: Graph Neural Networks for Supervised Node Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:427-446)
    quote: 'A graph neural network (GNN) builds a neural network based on the topology
      of the data graph... GNNs support end-to-end supervised learning for specific
      tasks: given a set of labelled examples, GNNs can be used to classify elements'
  description: GNNs enable supervised learning directly on graph structures by building
    neural networks that follow graph topology. Unlike embeddings which learn representations
    separately, GNNs learn task-specific classifications end-to-end. Applications
    include classifying nodes/graphs representing compounds, images, documents, and
    replacing traditional graph algorithms with learned approaches.
- name: Recursive GNNs with Transition Functions
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:452-462)
    quote: Recursive graph neural networks (RecGNNs) are the seminal approach... The
      approach is conceptually similar to the systolic abstraction... where messages
      are passed between neighbours towards recursively computing some result
  description: RecGNNs use message-passing between neighboring nodes with learned
    transition and output functions. The framework labels training nodes and learns
    functions to generate expected outputs, which can then classify unlabeled nodes.
    This architecture enables AI agents to learn from partial graph knowledge and
    generalize to new nodes.
- name: Convolutional GNNs with Attention Mechanisms
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:631-634)

    computational attention on the most informative connections for a given task.
- name: Symbolic Learning for Interpretable AI Models
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-674)
    quote: Such models are often difficult to explain or understand... An alternative
      approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic
      (logical) language that 'explain' a given set of positive and negative edges
  description: Symbolic learning provides interpretable alternatives to neural models
    by learning logical rules and axioms from knowledge graphs. Unlike opaque embeddings,
    symbolic models produce human-readable hypotheses that domain experts can verify,
    supporting explainable AI and enabling deductive reasoning on new data including
    previously unseen entities.
- name: Rule Mining for Knowledge Completion
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:704-715)
    quote: Rule mining, in the general sense, refers to discovering meaningful patterns
      in the form of rules from large collections of background knowledge... The goal
      of rule mining is to identify new rules that entail a high ratio of positive
      edges
  description: Rule mining discovers logical patterns from knowledge graphs that can
    predict new facts. Rules are scored by support (number of confirmed predictions)
    and confidence (ratio of correct predictions), enabling AI systems to learn generalizable
    knowledge completion strategies that apply to unseen data.

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:867-909)
    quote: differentiable rule mining, which allows end-to-end learning of rules.
      The core idea is that the joins in rule bodies can be represented as matrix
      multiplication
  description: Differentiable rule mining combines symbolic reasoning with neural
    learning by representing rule operations as matrix multiplications. Systems like
    NeuralLP use attention mechanisms to learn variable-length rule sequences, while
    DRUM uses bidirectional RNNs. This bridges interpretable symbolic AI with efficient
    gradient-based optimization.
- name: Ontology-Constrained Embedding Training
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-358)
    quote: The embeddings thus far consider the data graph alone. But what if an ontology
      or set of rules is provided? Such deductive knowledge could be used to improve
      the embeddings
  description: Entailment-aware embedding models incorporate ontological constraints
    to improve plausibility predictions. Functional and inverse-functional definitions
    serve as constraints, and systems like KALE use t-norm fuzzy logics to jointly
    train embeddings with rules. This integrates deductive and inductive AI approaches
    for more robust knowledge representation.

      this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity
      (process), with agents representing either software or human actors
  description: W3C PROV's Agent-Activity-Entity triad provides a foundational pattern
