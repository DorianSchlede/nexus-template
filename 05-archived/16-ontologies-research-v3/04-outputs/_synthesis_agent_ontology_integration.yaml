- name: Query Rewriting for Ontology-Guided Retrieval
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:92-109)
    quote: Another strategy is to use rules for query rewriting, which given a query,
      will automatically extend the query in order to find solutions entailed by a
      set of rules
  description: Agents can leverage query rewriting to expand user queries based on
    ontological rules. The ontology's class hierarchies and inference rules automatically
    extend queries to retrieve semantically related results. This pattern enables
    agents to find relevant information even when queries don't use exact ontological
    terms, supporting ontology-guided reasoning over knowledge graphs.
- name: Graph Parallel Frameworks for Agent Analytics
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:496-514)
    quote: Various frameworks have been proposed for large-scale graph analytics,
      often in a distributed (cluster) setting... These graph parallel frameworks
      apply a systolic abstraction based on a directed graph, where nodes are processors
      that can send messages to other nodes along edges
  description: Graph parallel frameworks like Apache Spark (GraphX), Pregel, and GraphLab
    provide a computational model where agents can perform distributed reasoning over
    knowledge graphs. The systolic abstraction enables message-passing between graph
    nodes, supporting agent-based traversal and aggregation of ontological knowledge
    at scale.
- name: Analytics Combined with Entailment for Agent Reasoning
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:728-764)
    quote: Knowledge graphs are often associated with a semantic schema or ontology
      that defines the semantics of domain terms, giving rise to entailments... Applying
      analytics with or without such entailments may yield radically different results
  description: Agents querying knowledge graphs must consider ontological entailments
    to get consistent results. The combination of graph analytics with semantic inference
    allows agents to analyze the semantic content of knowledge graphs rather than
    just topological features, enabling semantically-invariant analytics that yield
    same results over semantically-equivalent graphs.
- name: Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Agent Plausibility Scoring
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:768-822)
    quote: The main goal of knowledge graph embedding techniques is to create a dense
      representation of the graph in a continuous, low-dimensional vector space that
      can then be used for machine learning tasks
  description: Knowledge graph embeddings enable agents to compute plausibility scores
    for potential edges, supporting link prediction and confidence assignment. Agents
    can use these embeddings to evaluate assertions extracted from external sources,
    complete missing edges, and measure similarity between entities for recommendation
    or duplicate detection tasks.
- name: Entailment-Aware Embeddings for Rule Integration
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-390)
    quote: The embeddings thus far consider the data graph alone. But what if an ontology
      or set of rules is provided? Such deductive knowledge could be used to improve
      the embeddings
  description: Agents can leverage joint embeddings that combine both data graphs
    and ontological rules. KALE uses t-norm fuzzy logics to integrate rule-based reasoning
    with embedding plausibility scores. FSL trains relation embeddings while respecting
    inequalities implied by rules. This interplay between deductive (rules) and inductive
    (embeddings) knowledge enables more sophisticated agent reasoning.
- name: Graph Neural Networks for Supervised Agent Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:393-445)
    quote: A graph neural network (GNN) builds a neural network based on the topology
      of the data graph... Unlike knowledge graphs embeddings, GNNs support end-to-end
      supervised learning for specific tasks
  description: GNNs provide agents with supervised learning capabilities over graph-structured
    data. Agents can use GNNs to classify graph elements or entire graphs, predict
    traffic patterns, build recommendations, and even replace traditional graph algorithms
    for finding central nodes. The GNN topology mirrors the knowledge graph structure,
    enabling agents to learn task-specific patterns.
- name: Symbolic Learning for Interpretable Agent Models
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-696)
    quote: An alternative (sometimes complementary) approach is to adopt symbolic
      learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that
      explain a given set of positive and negative edges
  description: Symbolic learning enables agents to discover interpretable rules and
    axioms from knowledge graphs. Unlike numeric embedding models, symbolic models
    (rules, DL axioms) are interpretable, can be verified by domain experts, and apply
    to unseen examples through quantification. Agents can use learned rules for deductive
    reasoning and providing explanations for predictions.
- name: Rule Mining for Agent Knowledge Acquisition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:704-770)
    quote: Rule mining, in the general sense, refers to discovering meaningful patterns
      in the form of rules from large collections of background knowledge... The goal
      of rule mining is to identify new rules that entail a high ratio of positive
      edges from other positive edges
  description: Agents can use rule mining systems like AMIE to automatically discover
    logical rules from knowledge graphs. Rules are learned with support and confidence
    measures, enabling agents to identify patterns that generalize well. The Partial
    Completeness Assumption (PCA) handles incomplete data typical in real-world knowledge
    graphs.
- name: PROV-AGENT Model for Agentic Workflow Provenance
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:30-38)
    quote: PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the
      Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions
      into end-to-end workflow provenance
  description: PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV ontology to capture AI agent interactions
    within agentic workflows. It integrates agent-specific metadata (prompts, responses,
    decisions) with broader workflow context, enabling end-to-end traceability. This
    ontological extension allows agents and their actions to be first-class citizens
    in provenance graphs, supporting hallucination detection and root cause analysis.
- name: Agent-Activity-Entity Triad in PROV Ontology
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:197-204)
    quote: The W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in
      this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity
      (process), with agents representing either software or human actors responsible
      for activities
  description: 'W3C PROV provides a foundational ontological structure with three
    core classes: Agent, Entity, and Activity. This Agent-Activity-Entity triad serves
    as the basis for modeling AI agent interactions. Agents are responsible for activities
    that use and generate entities, creating a queryable provenance graph for understanding
    agent behavior.'
- name: AIAgent as Ontological Extension
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-296)
    quote: We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass,
      enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader
      workflow provenance graph
  description: PROV-AGENT models AIAgent as a subclass of PROV Agent, enabling ontology-guided
    integration of AI agents into workflow provenance. Agent tools (AgentTool) are
    associated with AIModelInvocations that use Prompts and generate ResponseData.
    This ontological structure supports multi-agent scenarios and captures collaborative
    or parallel agent behaviors.
- name: MCP-Based Agent Tool Provenance Capture
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:338-377)
    quote: Building on the MCP concepts, when the MCP server is initialized, we begin
      by creating a new instance of AIAgent... we introduce a new decorator, @flowcept_agent_tool,
      which creates a corresponding AgentTool execution activity
  description: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides standardized concepts for
    agentic AI development that can be captured in provenance ontology. Agent tools
    decorated with @flowcept_agent_tool automatically create AgentTool activities
    linked to executing agents via PROV relationships. This enables runtime capture
    of agent-ontology interactions.
- name: Provenance Queries for Agent Lineage Tracing
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:493-537)
    quote: Given an agent decision Agent_Decision_i, the query traverses to its generating
      Agent_Tool_i, then to the inputs it used... These are traced back through Model_Evaluation_i
      and Physics_Model_i to the original Sensor_Data_i
  description: Ontology-structured provenance enables sophisticated queries for tracing
    agent decisions. Agents can query their own lineage to understand decision origins,
    trace error propagation, identify hallucination sources, and understand downstream
    impacts. The unified provenance graph supports Q&A about agent reasoning, prompt-response
    relationships, and control flow influence.
- name: OCEL 2.0 Schema for Object-Event-Agent Relationships
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 4:197-331)
    quote: We defined a validation schema for the OCEL 2.0 JSON specification... events,
      objects, eventTypes, objectTypes with relationships and attributes
  description: OCEL 2.0 provides a JSON schema that structures object-centric event
    data with typed events, typed objects, and qualified relationships. Events contain
    relationships to objects with qualifiers explaining the nature of the relationship.
    This schema supports agents in understanding process semantics and enables ontology-based
    extraction and validation of event data.
- name: Standard Object and Event Types for AI Integration
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 4:386-405)
    quote: We also hope that OCEL 2.0 will also be the basis for creating standard
      object and event types for different application domains... This creates possibilities
      for both generative and discriminative Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  description: OCEL 2.0 aims to standardize object and event types across application
    domains, enabling AI agents to work with normalized process data. Standard taxonomies
    of objects/events with inheritance support both generative AI (creating process
    models) and discriminative AI (classifying process behaviors). Agents can leverage
    domain-standard ontologies without reinventing definitions.
- name: Object-Centric Process Mining with Ontological Metrics
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 10-OC-PM (Chunk 2:71-112)
    quote: We present some possibilities for conformance checking on top of object-centric
      event logs... confnum_obj and confdur_lif as the set of events/objects violating
      the rule
  description: Object-centric process mining enables agents to apply conformance checking
    rules to event logs. Agents can detect anomalies like excessive objects per activity
    or abnormal lifecycle durations using ontologically-defined constraints. The metrics
    (CC1, CC2) provide agents with model-independent verification of process properties.
- name: Graph Database Queries for Process Mining
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 10-OC-PM (Chunk 2:403-418)
    quote: In [18,19], the usage of graph databases for the storage, querying, and
      aggregation of object-centric event data is proposed. An object-centric event
      log is inserted in the graph by creating nodes for the events, objects, object
      types
  description: Graph databases provide agents with flexible query and aggregation
    capabilities over object-centric event data. Events, objects, and types become
    graph nodes with connecting edges based on log content. Ontology-based extraction
    approaches enable agents to query process data using semantic relationships rather
    than relational schemas.
- name: Ontology-Based Data Access for Event Log Extraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:426-433)
    quote: One noteworthy scientific initiative in this context is ontology-based
      data access (ODBA) for event log extraction. The approach is based on an ontological
      view of the domain of interest and linking it as such to a database schema
  description: Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) enables agents to extract event logs
    using ontological mappings to database schemas. Implemented in tools like Onprom,
    OBDA provides an ontological view of the domain that guides event extraction.
    Agents can leverage domain ontologies to transform relational data into process-oriented
    event logs without manual mapping.
- name: OCEL Standard for Multi-Case Agent Reasoning
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:431-433)
    quote: Finally, the recently introduced OCEL standard is another relevant piece
      of work, putting forward a general standard to interchange object-centric event
      data with multiple case notions
  description: The OCEL standard provides agents with a normalized format for object-centric
    event data supporting multiple case notions simultaneously. Agents can reason
    across different process perspectives without flattening data to a single case
    ID. This enables more sophisticated multi-object, multi-process analysis by AI
    agents.

      of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse
      scientific concepts'
  description: The framework integrates ontological knowledge graphs as the foundational
    substrate for multi-agent reasoning. The knowledge graph organizes and interconnects
    diverse scientific concepts, providing agents with structured context for hypothesis
    generation. This demonstrates how agents can interact with ontological structures
    to guide their reasoning and discovery process.
- name: Sub-graph Sampling for Agent Context Injection

      from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand
      the key concepts and their interrelationships
  description: Agents receive ontological context through sub-graph extraction rather
    than accessing the entire knowledge graph. This sampling strategy allows agents
    to work with focused, relevant portions of the ontology, enabling targeted reasoning
    while maintaining computational efficiency. The sub-graph serves as the agent's
    contextual knowledge substrate.

    quote: 'Each agent plays a specialized role: The Ontologist defines key concepts
      and relationships, Scientist 1 crafts a detailed research proposal'
  description: A dedicated Ontologist agent is responsible for defining concepts and
    relationships from the knowledge graph, translating ontological structure into
    actionable knowledge for other agents. This agent serves as the interface between
    the formal ontology and the reasoning agents, interpreting graph data into meaningful
    scientific relationships.
- name: Path-Based Graph Traversal for Knowledge Discovery
  sources:

    quote: At the core of our model is an expansive knowledge graph... we provide
      it with a sub-graph derived from this more extensive knowledge graph. This sub-graph
      depicts a pathway that connects two crucial concepts or nodes
  description: Agents interact with ontologies through path-based traversal, following
    connections between nodes to discover relationships. The path represents a chain
    of ontological relationships (concept -- relation -- concept) that guides agent
    reasoning. Random path sampling infuses richer conceptual diversity compared to
    shortest-path approaches.
- name: Dynamic Knowledge Generation from Static Ontology
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:289-296)
    quote: the agent helps transition from static knowledge retrieval to dynamic knowledge
      generation. This crucial shift is what enables the model to identify gaps in
      existing research and propose new angles of inquiry
  description: Agents use ontological structures not just for retrieval but for generative
    reasoning. The Ontologist agent applies advanced reasoning and inference techniques
    to synthesize and interpret the complex web of ontological data, extracting insights
    that are not obvious from the graph structure alone. This transforms static ontology
    into dynamic hypothesis generation.

      Scientist 1: crafts the initial draft... Critic: conducts a thorough review'
  description: The multi-agent system assigns specialized roles for processing ontological
    knowledge. The Ontologist agent specifically handles concept definition and relationship
    interpretation, while other agents (Planner, Scientists, Critic) build upon this
    ontological foundation. This demonstrates role-based decomposition of ontology-to-reasoning

      with node embeddings and randomized waypoints to discover diverse paths in a
      graph... the embeddings are generated using a pre-trained model
  description: Agents navigate ontological graphs using embedding-based heuristics
    rather than purely symbolic traversal. Node embeddings (using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5)
    enable semantic similarity-based pathfinding, allowing agents to discover conceptually
    related paths even when explicit ontological links are sparse. This hybrid symbolic-neural
    approach enhances agent-ontology interaction.

    quote: After the path is found, a subgraph consisting of the path nodes and their
      second-hop neighbors is generated, providing a broader context for the discovered
      route
  description: Agents receive expanded ontological context beyond the primary path
    by including second-hop neighbors. This enriches the agent's reasoning substrate

      for guiding the algorithm's search for the most relevant or exploratory paths
  description: 'The full pipeline shows how agents use ontologies: (1) identify key
    nodes, (2) generate path through knowledge graph, (3) extract sub-graph context,
    (4) expand definitions via Ontologist agent, (5) generate structured hypothesis
    via Scientist agents, (6) critique and refine via Critic agent. This demonstrates
    end-to-end ontology-guided agent reasoning.'

    quote: Corrective RAG introduces mechanisms to self-correct retrieval results...
      The core principle lies in its ability to evaluate retrieved documents dynamically,
      perform corrective actions, and refine queries
  description: Corrective RAG employs specialized agents (Relevance Evaluation, Query
    Refinement, External Knowledge Retrieval, Response Synthesis) that iteratively
    refine knowledge retrieval through ontological validation. Documents below relevance
    thresholds trigger corrective query reformulation.

      complexity of the incoming query... employs a classifier to assess query complexity
      and determine the most appropriate approach
  description: Adaptive RAG uses a classifier to ontologically categorize queries
    by complexity (straightforward, simple, complex), then routes to appropriate retrieval
    strategies. This dynamic categorization enables resource-efficient retrieval based
    on ontological query typing.

    database agents, semantic search agents, web search agents, and recommendation
    agents. This ontological division of labor enables parallel processing with type-specific

      (Short-Term and Long-Term), Planning (Reflection and Self-Critique), Tools (Vector
      Search, Web Search, APIs)'
  description: 'The paper defines a core ontology of AI agent components: LLM as reasoning
    engine, Memory for context persistence, Planning for task decomposition, and Tools
    for external capability extension. This four-component ontology provides a foundational
    model for agent architecture.'

      on task complexity
  description: 'The survey defines an ontology of agentic workflow patterns: Prompt
    Chaining (sequential processing), Routing (input classification), Parallelization
    (concurrent execution), Orchestrator-Workers (dynamic delegation), and Evaluator-Optimizer
    (iterative refinement). These patterns provide reusable ontological building blocks.'

    quote: Reflection is a foundational design pattern in agentic workflows, enabling
      agents to iteratively evaluate and refine their outputs. By incorporating self-feedback
      mechanisms, agents can identify and address errors
  description: The Reflection pattern enables agents to self-critique outputs using
    feedback loops. Agents generate outputs, critique them for correctness/style/efficiency,
    then incorporate feedback iteratively. This ontological self-improvement mechanism
    is demonstrated in Self-Refine, Reflexion, and CRITIC systems.

    quote: we present an exploratory study to investigate the use of LLMs for generating
      smart contract code from business process descriptions
  description: Pattern where LLMs consume formal process model representations (BPMN)
    and generate executable code (Solidity smart contracts). This represents a form
    of agent-ontology integration where the LLM reasons over structured ontological
    process models to produce code that enforces process flow, resource allocation,
    and data-based conditions. The ontology (BPMN metamodel) constrains and guides
    the LLM generation.

    quote: This encoding is embedded into the prompt, along with the model data, by
      the LLM provider interface, which calls the external LLM provider
  description: Pattern where ontological structures (task IDs, participant IDs, process
    encodings) are embedded into LLM prompts to guide generation. The simulator generates
    encodings that map events and participants to structured representations in smart
    contracts. This shows how ontological metadata becomes part of the agent's context
    for reasoning.
- name: Process Trace Replay for Ontology Conformance Verification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:238-251)
    quote: An established method to benchmark the correctness of a blockchain-based
      business process is to replay all possible conforming traces (which the smart
      contract has to accept)
  description: Pattern for verifying that LLM-generated code conforms to ontological
    process specifications. Conforming and non-conforming traces are generated from
    the process model (ontology) and replayed against generated artifacts. This represents
    ontology-driven validation of agent outputs, ensuring the agent's work aligns
    with formal process semantics.

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:54-61)
    quote: Blockchain-based business process execution relies on a model-driven paradigm,
      where process descriptions are transformed into executable artefacts based on
      rule-based transformation tools
  description: Integration pattern where traditional rule-based model-to-code transformations
    are augmented with LLM capabilities. LLMs overcome limitations of rigid rule-based
    approaches while still operating on ontologically-structured process models. The
    ontology provides the formal input structure that the LLM transforms.

    quote: In zero-shot prompting, models complete tasks based solely on instructions
      without prior examples, whereas few-shot prompting involves providing a handful
      of illustrative examples
  description: Pattern where agents learn ontology-to-code translation through limited
    examples. One-shot and two-shot prompts with ontological process models guide
    the LLM to produce correct translations. The examples encode the mapping between
    ontological concepts (BPMN elements) and their code representations.

      state change in the contract), and the whole trace led to the end event'
  description: Pattern using ontological specifications to create automated evaluation
    metrics for agent outputs. Process conformance checking based on ontological trace
    definitions (True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, False Negative) enables
    systematic benchmarking of LLM-generated artifacts against formal process specifications.

      queries
  description: Pattern for agent-ontology integration via SPARQL query generation.
    Competency questions (natural language) are translated to SPARQL queries against
    the BBO ontology knowledge base. This enables agents to retrieve structured answers
    about process resources, task sequences, manufacturing facilities, and resource
    types from the ontological representation.

  description: Pattern for agents to navigate process execution paths using ontological
    relationships. By querying SequenceFlow relationships and FlowNode references,
    agents can determine task ordering, conditional branches, and execution dependencies.
    This enables dynamic process guidance based on formal ontology structure.

    quote: We have performed queries on the inferred ontology, which explains the
      three answers to question 4
  description: Pattern leveraging ontological reasoning (inference) to resolve resource
    types and classifications. Queries on the inferred ontology return hierarchical
    type information (SoftwareResource, Resource, NamedIndividual), enabling agents
    to reason about resource taxonomy and inheritance relationships defined in BBO.
- name: Ontology-Constrained Output Validation

    quote: This could involve using LLMs to propose code snippets or modifications,
      which are then rigorously checked against formal specifications
  description: Pattern for responsible AI integration where ontological specifications
    serve as validation constraints for LLM outputs. LLMs propose code that is verified
    against formal process specifications using automated theorem provers or benchmarking
    frameworks. The ontology defines the 'ground truth' for correctness checking.

      Processing pipeline
  description: Pattern for populating ontologies from natural language using NLP/AI
    pipelines. Technical documents describing business processes are processed to
    extract ontological assertions that instantiate the BBO knowledge base. This enables
    automated knowledge base construction from unstructured sources, which agents
    can then query.
