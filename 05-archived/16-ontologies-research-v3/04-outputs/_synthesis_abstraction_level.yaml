- name: UFO as Foundational Ontology
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:107)
    quote: UFO, OntoUML, foundational ontology, ontological analysis, formal ontology
  description: UFO is explicitly positioned as a foundational ontology - the highest
    level of abstraction in the ontology stack. Foundational ontologies provide domain-independent
    categories and principles that can be specialized for domain and application ontologies.
    This is the most abstract level, dealing with fundamental philosophical categories
    rather than domain-specific concepts.
- name: Four-Category Ontology Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:116-117)
    quote: UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling
      notions via a set of micro-theories
  description: UFO's abstraction level is characterized by its four-category structure
    based on the Aristotelian Square, distinguishing both substantials and accidents
    (particularized properties) at both the type and instance levels. This foundational
    structure enables domain-independent categorization of all possible entities.
- name: Micro-Theory Architecture
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:117-142)
    quote: a theory of types and taxonomic structures... a theory of part-whole relations...
      a theory of particularized intrinsic properties
  description: 'UFO''s foundational abstraction is organized as a collection of micro-theories
    addressing fundamental ontological concepts: types and taxonomic structures, part-whole
    relations, particularized properties, relations, roles, events, and multi-level
    modeling. Each micro-theory provides foundational patterns that can be specialized
    at lower abstraction levels.'
- name: Three-Fragment Organization (UFO-A, UFO-B, UFO-C)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:270-279)
    quote: UFO-A, which is an ontology of endurants; UFO-B, which is an ontology of
      perdurants; UFO-C, which is an ontology of social and intentional entities
  description: 'UFO is organized into three main fragments at the foundational level:
    UFO-A (endurants/objects), UFO-B (perdurants/events), and UFO-C (social/intentional
    entities built on UFO-A and UFO-B). This modular organization at the foundational
    level enables selective specialization for domain ontologies.'
- name: Endurant-Perdurant Fundamental Distinction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-289)
    quote: UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between
      endurants... and perdurants
  description: At the foundational abstraction level, UFO makes the fundamental distinction
    between endurants (entities existing wholly at any time) and perdurants (entities
    unfolding in time with temporal parts). This is a domain-independent ontological
    distinction that applies across all possible domains.
- name: Substantial vs Moment Distinction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:297-301)
    quote: UFO is an ontology based of the so-called Aristotelian Square, thus, accounting
      for both substantial individuals... as well as particularized properties
  description: The foundational level distinguishes between independent entities (substantials
    like objects) and dependent entities (moments/particularized properties). This
    Aristotelian Square structure provides the most abstract categorization framework
    for all entities.
- name: Universals and Particulars Hierarchy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:363-367)
    quote: UFO is an ontology of both particulars and universals (or types)... UFO
      is an ontology that also countenances high-order types, i.e., types whose instances
      are also types
  description: UFO's foundational abstraction includes both particulars (individual
    instances) and universals (types/patterns). The inclusion of higher-order types
    (types of types) demonstrates the multi-level abstraction capability of the ontology,
    supporting meta-modeling at the foundational level.
- name: Kind as Identity Provider
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:368-377)
    quote: a fundamental sort of endurant type is a kind, which provides uniform principles
      of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances
  description: At the foundational level, Kinds provide the essential identity criteria
    for entities. This is a domain-independent abstraction that defines how any entity
    maintains identity through change. Person, Organization, and Marriage are examples
    of Kinds at a lower (domain) abstraction level.
- name: Sortal vs Non-Sortal Type Distinction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:378-395)
    quote: In contrast with sortals, non-sortals are types that represent common properties
      of individuals of multiple Kinds
  description: The foundational level distinguishes sortals (types with identity principles)
    from non-sortals (types crossing multiple Kinds). Categories, Phase Mixins, Role
    Mixins, and Mixins are foundational non-sortal patterns that enable abstraction
    across domain Kinds.
- name: Descriptive vs Revisionary Approach
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:255-269)
    quote: UFO was constructed as a descriptive (as opposed to a revisionary) project...
      This means that it is an ontology that takes into full consideration both cognitive
      and linguistic aspects
  description: UFO's foundational abstraction takes a descriptive approach rather
    than revisionary, meaning it aims to capture how humans cognitively structure
    reality at the mesoscopic level. This positions UFO as providing foundational
    categories that align with human conceptualization rather than purely formal constructs.
- name: Grounding for Domain Ontologies
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:202-208)
    quote: It has been employed as a basis for analyzing, reengineering, and integrating
      many modeling languages and standards in different domains (e.g., UML, BPMN,
      ArchiMate)
  description: UFO's foundational abstraction level is validated by its use as grounding
    for domain-level modeling languages and standards. The foundational categories
    (Agent, Activity, Entity, etc.) are specialized in domain ontologies like BBO
    (BPMN-based) and enterprise architecture ontologies.
- name: Calculus of Content Purpose
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:235-238)
    quote: The idea was to develop a 'Calculus of Content' aimed at supporting the
      ontological analysis, conceptual clarification, and semantic explicitation
  description: UFO's foundational purpose is to serve as a 'Calculus of Content' -
    a domain-independent framework for analyzing and clarifying concepts. This meta-level
    purpose confirms UFO's position at the foundational abstraction layer, designed
    to support rather than replace domain-specific ontologies.
- name: UFO as Foundational Ontology for Domain Ontologies
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:567-569)
    quote: Over the years, UFO has been used for the development of core and domain
      ontologies on a wide range of domains, both in academic and industrial contexts.
  description: UFO operates at the foundational abstraction level, serving as a philosophical
    grounding layer from which core and domain ontologies are derived. This demonstrates
    the hierarchical relationship between abstraction levels where foundational ontologies
    enable the construction of lower-level domain-specific ontologies.
- name: UFO Grounding of Multiple Domain Languages and Standards
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:664-689)
    quote: 'Moreover, UFO and ontologies built with it have been used to analyze,
      reengineer, or integrate many modeling languages and standards in different
      domains: ArchiMate, ARIS, DEMO, ISO/IEC 24744...'
  description: UFO at the foundational level provides the theoretical basis for analyzing
    and reengineering application-level modeling languages like ArchiMate, BPMN, TOGAF,
    UML. This shows how foundational abstraction enables standardization and integration
    across domain and application levels.
- name: OntoUML as Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Bridge
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:690-696)
    quote: A recent study shows that UFO is the second-most used foundational ontology
      in conceptual modeling and the one with the fastest adoption rate. That study
      also shows that OntoUML is among the most used languages in ontology-driven
      conceptual modeling
  description: OntoUML serves as a modeling language at the application level that
    instantiates UFO's foundational concepts, demonstrating how foundational ontologies
    are operationalized through specialized modeling languages for practical conceptual
    modeling tasks.
- name: Knowledge Graph Definition with Explicit Abstraction Hierarchy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-156)
    quote: we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and
      convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest
      and whose edges represent relations between these entities
  description: Knowledge graphs are defined at the application level as data structures
    that accumulate knowledge. They can be enhanced with representations of schema,
    identity, context, ontologies and/or rules - showing how application-level graphs
    can incorporate higher abstraction levels (ontologies, rules) for semantic enrichment.
- name: 'Three-Level Schema Abstraction: Semantic, Validating, Emergent'
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:997-998)
    quote: 'We discuss three types of graph schemata: semantic, validating, and emergent.'
  description: 'The paper identifies three distinct abstraction levels for graph schemata:
    semantic schemas (defining term meaning and enabling reasoning), validating schemas
    (prescribing structural constraints), and emergent schemas (automatically extracted
    patterns). This tripartite distinction represents different purposes and abstraction
    levels within schema design.'
- name: Semantic Schema for High-Level Term Definitions
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:101-104)
    quote: A semantic schema allows for defining the meaning of high-level terms (aka
      vocabulary or terminology) used in the graph, which facilitates reasoning over
      graphs using those terms.
  description: Semantic schemas operate at a higher abstraction level, defining vocabulary
    semantics (subclasses, subproperties, domains, ranges) that enable deductive reasoning.
    They represent the core/domain ontology level that provides semantic grounding
    for application-level data.
- name: Class Hierarchy as Foundational-to-Domain Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:115-118)
    quote: we present a class hierarchy for events where children are defined to be
      subclasses of their parents such that if we find an edge EID15 type Food Festival
      in our graph, we may also infer that EID15 type Festival and EID15 type Event
  description: Class hierarchies demonstrate vertical abstraction within ontologies
    - from specific application concepts (Food Festival) up through domain concepts
    (Festival) to general concepts (Event). This pattern shows how abstraction levels
    enable inference through subsumption.
- name: RDFS and OWL as Core Ontology Standards
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:176-190)
    quote: A prominent standard for defining a semantic schema for (RDF) graphs is
      the RDF Schema (RDFS) standard, which allows for defining subclasses, subproperties,
      domains, and ranges... More generally, the semantics of terms used in a graph
      can be defined in much more depth than seen here, as is supported by the Web
      Ontology Language (OWL)
  description: RDFS operates at the core ontology level providing basic schema vocabulary,
    while OWL extends this to support more expressive domain and foundational ontology
    features. This layered approach demonstrates abstraction hierarchy within semantic
    web standards.
- name: Open World vs Closed World Assumption as Abstraction Choice
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:192-222)
    quote: Semantic schema are typically defined for incomplete graph data, where
      the absence of an edge between two nodes... does not mean that the relation
      does not hold in the real world... the Open World Assumption (OWA)... Closed
      World Assumption (CWA)
  description: The choice between OWA and CWA represents an abstraction-level decision
    about completeness assumptions. Foundational and domain ontologies typically adopt
    OWA (incomplete knowledge), while application databases often use CWA (complete
    knowledge), reflecting different abstraction purposes.
- name: Validating Schema as Application-Level Constraints
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:230-248)
    quote: We may wish to ensure that all events have at least a name, a venue, a
      start date, and an end date... We can define such constraints in a validating
      schema and validate the data graph with respect to the resulting schema
  description: Validating schemas operate at the application level, defining structural
    constraints for data quality rather than semantic meaning. This contrasts with
    semantic schemas that operate at domain/foundational levels for reasoning purposes.
- name: Shapes as Application-Level Validation Constructs
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:250-261)
    quote: A standard way to define a validating schema for graphs is using shapes.
      A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on
      those nodes.
  description: Shape languages (ShEx, SHACL) provide application-level validation
    mechanisms that complement higher-level semantic schemas. Shapes define what data
    conformance means at the instance level, operating below the abstraction of semantic
    ontologies.
- name: Emergent Schema as Bottom-Up Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:434-439)
    quote: Both semantic and validating schemata require a domain expert to explicitly
      specify definitions and constraints. However, a data graph will often exhibit
      latent structures that can be automatically extracted as an emergent schema
      (aka graph summary)
  description: Emergent schemas represent a bottom-up abstraction approach where patterns
    are induced from data rather than prescribed top-down. This contrasts with foundational/domain
    ontologies that are designed top-down, demonstrating methodology differences across
    abstraction levels.
- name: Quotient Graphs for Structural Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:439-458)
    quote: A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient
      graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some
      equivalence relation while preserving some structural properties of the graph.
  description: Quotient graphs provide a formal mechanism for creating abstractions
    of data graphs, partitioning nodes into equivalence classes. This represents computational
    abstraction where complex graphs are simplified while preserving essential structural
    properties for analysis.
- name: Ontology as Formal Convention for Term Meaning
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:311-339)
    quote: In the context of computing, an ontology is then a concrete, formal representation
      of what terms mean within the scope in which they are used (e.g., a given domain).
  description: Ontologies formalize meaning at their respective abstraction level
    - foundational ontologies define universal concepts, domain ontologies define
    domain-specific concepts, and application ontologies constrain terms for specific
    use cases. The abstraction level determines the scope of convention.
- name: Interpretation as Abstraction Between Data and Domain
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:361-395)
    quote: 'we can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed
      of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms (nodes and edge-labels)
      of the data graph to those of the domain graph'
  description: The concept of interpretation formalizes the abstraction relationship
    between syntactic data graphs (application level) and semantic domain graphs (conceptual
    level). This mapping is fundamental to how ontologies at different abstraction
    levels relate to instance data.
- name: OWL Language Profiles as Abstraction Trade-offs
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:4-18)
    quote: on any input ontology but may miss entailments, returning false instead
      of true, (2) always halt with the correct answer but only accept input ontologies
      with restricted features, or (3) only return correct answers for any input ontology
      but may never halt
  description: OWL profiles (OWL 2 RL, OWL 2 QL, OWL 2 EL) represent different abstraction
    trade-offs between expressivity and computability. Higher expressivity allows
    more foundational axioms but may sacrifice decidability, while restricted profiles
    enable efficient application-level reasoning.
- name: Rules vs Description Logics as Reasoning Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:21-52)
    quote: One of the most straightforward ways to provide automated access to deductive
      knowledge is through inference rules... Rules can be used to capture entailments
      under ontological conditions
  description: Rules provide an operational abstraction for ontological entailment,
    translating high-level semantic axioms into executable if-then patterns. This
    represents the translation from declarative foundational/domain semantics to procedural
    application-level computation.
- name: Description Logics as Foundational-Level Formalism
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:127-163)
    quote: Description Logics (DLs) were initially introduced as a way to formalise
      the meaning of frames and semantic networks... DLs form a family of logics rather
      than a particular logic. Initially, DLs were restricted fragments of First Order
      Logic (FOL)
  description: Description Logics operate at the foundational abstraction level, providing
    the logical formalism that underlies OWL and other ontology languages. The family
    of DLs (ALC, SHIQ, SROIQ, etc.) represents different points in the expressivity-complexity
    trade-off space for foundational representation.
- name: Four-category definition hierarchy for knowledge graphs
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:127-142)
    quote: 'Category I: The first category simply defines the knowledge graph as a
      graph where nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships'
  description: The paper identifies four distinct categories of knowledge graph definitions,
    each representing a different level of abstraction. Category I is the most basic
    (graph of entities/relations), Category II adds knowledge base structure, Category
    III adds technical characteristics, and Category IV uses extensional/example-based
    definitions. This hierarchy demonstrates how abstraction levels vary based on
    definitional purpose.
- name: Foundational versus domain ontology distinction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:75-84)
    quote: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology ISO standard used to
      provide foundational classes to structure different domain ontologies
  description: 'Explicit distinction between foundational/top-level ontologies (BFO)
    and domain ontologies. BFO provides abstract philosophical grounding while domain
    ontologies address specific application areas. This establishes the ontology stack
    abstraction levels: foundational -> core/mid-level (CCO) -> domain.'
- name: Mid-level ontology bridging role (CCO)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:82-84)
    quote: The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) are a suite of mid-level ontologies, used
      to span across different domain ontologies and intended to bridge the gap between
      domain ontologies and BFO
  description: CCO occupies a distinct 'mid-level' abstraction layer, explicitly positioned
    between foundational ontologies (BFO) and domain ontologies. This three-tier architecture
    (foundational-core-domain) is a key abstraction pattern for ontology design.
- name: PROV-O as core/domain level ontology
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:24-28)
    quote: The Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended
      ontology used to structure data about provenance across a wide variety of domains
  description: PROV-O is positioned as a core/domain level ontology that can be mapped
    to foundational ontologies (BFO). It is generic enough to span domains but specific
    enough to require grounding in higher-level abstractions.
- name: Total alignment as maximum interoperability
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:277-284)
    quote: When every term in one ontology is surjectively mapped onto by at least
      one term in the other ontology, this constitutes a total alignment
  description: Total alignment represents complete mapping between abstraction levels.
    The paper provides formal criteria for evaluating how well lower-level ontologies
    (PROV-O) can be mapped to foundational ontologies (BFO), enabling interoperability
    across abstraction levels.
- name: Interpretability between ontology levels
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:304-312)
    quote: An ontology O1 is interpretable in ontology O2 if and only if there exists
      a set of translation definitions (an alignment) for O1 into O2 such that O2
      union with alignment entails O1
  description: Formal definition of interpretability between ontologies at different
    abstraction levels. When a domain ontology is interpretable in a foundational
    ontology, all logical implications are preserved when translating 'up' the abstraction
    hierarchy.
- name: Synonymy as bidirectional interpretation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:333-346)
    quote: Two ontologies O1 and O2 are synonymous if and only if there exist two
      sets of translation definitions, respectively from O1 to O2 and from O2 to O1
  description: Synonymy represents the theoretical limit of semantic interoperability
    between abstraction levels - when two ontologies can fully understand each other
    in both directions. This is the gold standard for ontology alignment across abstraction
    levels.
- name: Abstraction-specific mapping predicates
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:146-164)
    quote: Equivalence relations represented by OWL equivalentClass and OWL equivalentProperty
      give necessary and sufficient conditions... Subsumption relations represented
      by RDFS subClassOf or RDFS subPropertyOf give sufficient conditions
  description: Different predicate types (equivalence vs subsumption) enable different
    degrees of cross-level mapping. Equivalence provides bidirectional bridges while
    subsumption provides one-way bridges from lower to higher abstraction levels.
- name: PROV-AGENT as workflow-level provenance extension
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:30-33)
    quote: we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages
      the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions
  description: PROV-AGENT extends the W3C PROV standard to a new abstraction level
    specifically for agentic workflows. This demonstrates how core ontologies can
    be specialized downward to application-specific domains while maintaining compatibility
    with the parent abstraction.
- name: Three-level PROV architecture (Agent-Activity-Entity)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:200-204)
    quote: the W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in
      this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity
      (process)
  description: W3C PROV establishes a foundational three-class abstraction (Agent-Activity-Entity)
    that serves as the basis for provenance modeling. This triad maps directly to
    fundamental ontological distinctions and provides a universal pattern for process/workflow
    abstraction.
- name: Hierarchical class extension pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-284)
    quote: We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass,
      enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader
      workflow provenance graph
  description: AIAgent is modeled as a subclass of W3C PROV Agent, demonstrating how
    abstraction hierarchies are extended downward through subclassing. This pattern
    preserves compatibility with the parent abstraction while adding domain-specific
    semantics.
- name: DataObject as entity abstraction layer
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:298-302)
    quote: The data used or generated by agents, including prompts, responses, are
      represented as subclasses of the DataObject Entity. This allows agents to consume
      and produce not only DomainData, but also system-level and contextual data
  description: DataObject serves as an intermediate abstraction layer between the
    generic PROV Entity and specific data types (DomainData, SchedulingData, TelemetryData).
    This demonstrates multi-level specialization within a single ontology.
- name: Tensor order as mathematical abstraction levels
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:65-69)
    quote: A tensor is a multidimensional numeric field that generalises scalars (0-order
      tensors), vectors (1-order tensors) and matrices (2-order tensors) towards arbitrary
      dimension/order
  description: Mathematical abstraction levels for representing knowledge graph data
    structures. Tensor order provides a formal hierarchy from scalars through vectors
    and matrices to arbitrary n-dimensional structures, enabling different levels
    of representational complexity.
- name: Embedding dimensionality as abstraction granularity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:196-198)
    quote: DistMult is a seminal method for computing knowledge graph embeddings based
      on rank decompositions, where each entity and relation is associated with a
      vector of dimension d
  description: The dimensionality d of embeddings determines the abstraction granularity
    - higher dimensions capture more latent features but increase complexity. This
    trade-off between expressivity and tractability is a key abstraction design decision.
- name: Expressivity-complexity trade-off in neural models
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:282-291)
    quote: The presented approaches strike different balances in terms of expressivity
      and the number of parameters that need to be trained. While more expressive
      models...may better fit more complex plausibility functions
  description: Neural embedding models operate at different abstraction levels based
    on their expressivity. Simpler models (TransE, DistMult) provide coarser abstractions
    while complex models (NTN, ConvE) enable finer-grained representation at the cost
    of more parameters.
- name: Symbolic versus subsymbolic abstraction levels
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-651)
    quote: The supervised techniques discussed thus far...learn numerical models over
      graphs. However, such models are often difficult to explain or understand
  description: Fundamental distinction between symbolic (interpretable rules/axioms)
    and subsymbolic (embeddings/neural) abstraction levels. Symbolic approaches provide
    human-interpretable abstractions while subsymbolic approaches provide continuous
    numerical representations.
- name: Rule abstraction from simple to complex
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:59-75)
    quote: DL Learner, which is based on algorithms for class learning (aka concept
      learning), whereby given a set of positive nodes and negative nodes, the goal
      is to find a logical class description
  description: Class learning represents abstraction from instance data to class-level
    descriptions. The refinement operator moves between more general and more specific
    classes, demonstrating how abstraction levels can be navigated within symbolic
    reasoning.
- name: Continuant-occurrent as foundational abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:636-645)
    quote: We therefore map PROV Entity as a subclass of BFO continuant with one exception...
      This disjoint relationship is entailed by additionally mapping PROV Activity
      to a subclass of BFO occurrent because continuants and occurrents are disjoint
  description: The BFO continuant/occurrent distinction represents a fundamental philosophical
    abstraction dividing entities that persist through time (continuants) from those
    that unfold in time (occurrents). This foundational-level abstraction constrains
    all downstream domain ontology design.
- name: DOLCE Foundational Ontology Status
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:13-23)
    quote: DOLCE, the first top-level (foundational) ontology to be axiomatized, has
      remained stable for twenty years
  description: DOLCE is explicitly identified as a foundational (top-level) ontology.
    Its purpose is to provide general categories and relations needed to give a coherent
    view of reality, integrate domain knowledge, and mediate across domains. It is
    not directly concerned with domain knowledge but serves as philosophical grounding
    for more specific ontologies.

    quote: when this strategy is applied to foundational ontologies, interoperability
      is possible also between the domain ontologies aligned to them
  description: 'DOLCE establishes a clear abstraction hierarchy: foundational ontologies
    enable interoperability between domain ontologies that are aligned to them. This
    demonstrates the layered abstraction approach where foundational ontologies sit

    quote: such categories are mostly situated at a mesoscopic level, and may change
      while scientific knowledge or social consensus evolve
  description: DOLCE's categories operate at a 'mesoscopic level' - between microscopic
    physical reality and macroscopic social constructs. This represents a foundational
    abstraction that captures commonsense human cognition rather than ultimate physical
    reality.
- name: Expressiveness vs Computability Trade-off
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:59-62)
    quote: richness greatly enhances expressiveness but, on the other hand, it makes
      foundational ontologies non computable, due to the well-known trade-off between
      formal expressiveness and computability
  description: Foundational ontologies face an inherent tension between abstraction
    level and practical use. Rich axiomatization in first-order modal logic provides
    semantic transparency but requires 'lite' versions for application-oriented languages,
    creating a cascade of abstraction levels.

    quote: most basic categories, which in DOLCE were called 'endurant' and 'perdurant'
      and which become 'object' and 'event' in DOLCE-CORE
  description: DOLCE-CORE represents a move toward more intuitive terminology at the
    foundational level, using 'object' and 'event' instead of 'endurant' and 'perdurant'.
    This demonstrates how foundational ontologies can provide different terminological
    abstractions while maintaining the same ontological commitments.

      stabilizer... (4) as a source of patterns'
  description: 'DOLCE operates at multiple abstraction levels depending on use case:
    as a minimal upper ontology for agreement, as a detailed axiomatic theory for
    meaning negotiation, as a consistency checker, or as a source of reusable patterns.
    This multi-level application distinguishes foundational from domain ontologies.'

      in a consistent fashion those upper-level categories common to domain ontologies
      developed by scientists in different fields
  description: BFO's foundational abstraction level is characterized by deliberate
    minimalism - only 34 terms. This smallness reflects the principle that foundational
    ontologies should contain only the most general categories, leaving domain-specific
    concepts to lower-level ontologies.

      and (2) occurrents
  description: BFO's foundational abstraction is built on a fundamental dichotomy
    between continuants (persisting entities) and occurrents (events/processes). This
    binary division at the highest abstraction level structures all domain-level categorization.

    quote: The terms used in biological ontologies such as the Gene Ontology refer
      to types; experiments carried out by biologists in their labs refer to corresponding
      instances
  description: BFO distinguishes between type-level (universal) and instance-level
    (particular) abstractions. Scientific theories concern types/universals, while
    experimental data concern instances. This type-instance hierarchy is orthogonal

    quote: BFO, in contrast, is founded on a bicategorial approach which seeks to
      combine elements of both the three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives
  description: BFO operates at a foundational abstraction level that synthesizes two
    competing philosophical frameworks (3D continuants and 4D occurrents) into a single
    coherent framework. This represents a high-level ontological decision that constrains
    all downstream domain modeling.

      continuants
  description: 'BFO''s foundational abstraction recapitulates Aristotle''s ontological
    square: substances/accidents crossed with universals/particulars. This philosophical
    grounding places BFO at the most abstract metaphysical level.'

      speed profile...'
  description: Within the occurrent branch, BFO allows for hierarchical abstraction
    of process types from determinable (speed profile) to determinate (2 mph constant

      event log given the choice of an object type. This is useful because many process
      mining approaches are only available for traditional event logs
  description: The 'flattening' operation demonstrates abstraction level transformation
    - converting richer object-centric representations to simpler case-centric ones.

  description: The foundational data model abstraction using labeled property graphs

  - chunk_ref: 19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:17-21)
    quote: The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information
      generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ('LLM
      thoughts') are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies
  description: GoT introduces a graph abstraction level for LLM reasoning that generalizes
    previous approaches (CoT, ToT). This abstraction represents thoughts as vertices
    and dependencies as edges, enabling arbitrary reasoning patterns at a higher abstraction
    level than linear chains or tree structures.

    quote: Aggregation Transformations... Refining Transformations... Generation Transformations
  description: 'GoT defines three abstraction levels for thought transformations:
    (1) Aggregation (combining multiple thoughts), (2) Refining (iterating on single
    thoughts), (3) Generation (creating new thoughts from existing ones). These represent
    different levels of reasoning abstraction applicable to the graph structure.'
- name: Latency-Volume Tradeoff Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:732-743)
    quote: For a given thought t, the volume of t is the number of preceding LLM thoughts
      that could have impacted t... We assume that outputting a single thought costs
      O(1) time
  description: The paper introduces 'volume' as a new abstraction metric measuring
    how many thoughts contribute to a final outcome. This metric provides a way to
    abstract and compare the reasoning depth across different prompting paradigms
    (CoT, ToT, GoT), enabling theoretical analysis at a higher level than implementation
    details.
- name: Graph of Operations (GoO) Abstraction Layer
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:390-396)
    quote: GoO is a static structure that specifies the graph decomposition of a given
      task, i.e., it prescribes transformations to be applied to LLM thoughts, together
      with their order & dependencies
  description: The Graph of Operations (GoO) serves as an abstraction layer between
    task decomposition strategy and runtime execution. It provides a static, declarative
    abstraction for specifying how thoughts should be transformed, separate from the
    dynamic Graph Reasoning State (GRS) that tracks actual execution.
- name: RAG Paradigm Evolution Abstraction Hierarchy
  sources:

    quote: This section examines the progression of RAG paradigms, presenting key
      stages of development - Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and
      Agentic RAG
  description: The paper presents a clear abstraction hierarchy for RAG systems, progressing
    from simple to complex. Naive RAG represents the foundational/basic level, Advanced
    RAG adds semantic understanding, Modular RAG introduces component flexibility,
    Graph RAG adds relational reasoning, and Agentic RAG represents the highest application-level
    abstraction with autonomous decision-making. This demonstrates domain-level abstraction
    within AI systems.
- name: Agentic Pattern Abstraction Levels
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:507-510)
    quote: Agentic Patterns provide structured methodologies that guide the behavior
      of agents in Agentic RAG systems. These patterns enable agents to dynamically
      adapt, plan, and collaborate
  description: Four agentic patterns (Reflection, Planning, Tool Use, Multi-Agent)
    represent different abstraction levels for agent behavior. Reflection is foundational
    (self-evaluation), Planning adds task decomposition, Tool Use enables external
    capability extension, and Multi-Agent represents the highest orchestration level.
    This is a domain-level abstraction pattern for AI agent design.
- name: Single vs Multi vs Hierarchical Agent Architecture Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:746-749)
    quote: Agentic RAG systems can be categorized into distinct architectural frameworks
      based on their complexity and design principles. These include single-agent,
      multi-agent, and hierarchical agentic architectures
  description: 'The taxonomy presents three abstraction levels for agentic systems:
    single-agent (simplest, centralized), multi-agent (modular, distributed), and
    hierarchical (tiered with strategic oversight). This represents application-level
    abstraction for system architecture design, where higher levels add complexity
    and coordination capabilities.'
- name: Workflow Pattern Complexity Abstraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:613-614)
    quote: Agentic workflow patterns structure LLM-based applications to optimize
      performance, accuracy, and efficiency. Different approaches are suitable depending
      on task complexity
  description: Workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers,
    Evaluator-Optimizer) represent different abstraction levels for task orchestration.
    Simpler patterns like Prompt Chaining are foundational, while Orchestrator-Workers
    and Evaluator-Optimizer represent higher application-level abstractions for complex
    task management.
- name: Hierarchical Agent Tier Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 2:103-106)
    quote: Hierarchical Agentic RAG systems employ a structured, multi-tiered approach
      to information retrieval. Agents are organized in a hierarchy, with higher-level
      agents overseeing lower-level agents
  description: 'This describes a concrete application-level abstraction with explicit
    tiers: top-tier agents (strategic decision-making), mid-level agents (specialized
    retrieval), and lower-level agents (execution). The abstraction enables multi-level
    decision-making and task delegation based on query complexity.'
- name: Document Workflow Abstraction Layers
  sources:

    quote: Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) extend traditional RAG paradigms by enabling
      end-to-end knowledge work automation. These workflows orchestrate complex document-centric
      processes
  description: ADW represents a domain-specific application-level abstraction that
    integrates document parsing, retrieval, reasoning, and structured outputs. It
    demonstrates how foundational RAG concepts are elevated to domain-specific workflow
    automation, with state maintenance across multi-step processes.

    quote: Blockchain-based business process execution relies on a model-driven paradigm,
      where process descriptions are transformed into executable artefacts based on
      rule-based transformation tools
  description: This describes abstraction bridging from domain-level (BPMN process
    models) to application-level (executable smart contracts). The transformation
    represents a vertical abstraction relationship where high-level business process
    descriptions are translated into low-level executable code, demonstrating how
    ontological concepts at one abstraction level map to implementation at another.
- name: Foundation Model Abstraction for Code Generation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:131-137)
    quote: LLMs are a specific class of Foundation Models, a class of machine learning
      models trained on extensive data sets, not for one specific purpose but as a
      basis for many possible applications
  description: Foundation Models represent a foundational abstraction level that serves
    as a base for multiple application-level uses. The paper describes how LLMs (foundational)
    can be applied to domain-specific tasks like smart contract generation (application
    level), demonstrating the foundational-to-application abstraction relationship.
- name: BPMN Choreography as Domain Abstraction
  sources:

    quote: In the current instantiation of our framework, we support BPMN 2.0 Choreographies.
      This is a purely practical implementation choice, given that there is no consensus
      on the best fitting modelling paradigm
  description: BPMN 2.0 Choreographies represent a domain-level abstraction for modeling
    inter-organizational business processes. The paper acknowledges this as one possible
    modeling paradigm, indicating that multiple domain-level abstractions exist for
    representing blockchain-based execution patterns.
- name: Process Characteristic Evaluation Framework Perspectives

    quote: Table 2 visualizes the process characteristics evaluation framework (PCEF).
      We present five perspectives - task, time, data, system, and human - that contain
      several characteristics
  description: The PCEF represents a domain-level abstraction framework for RPA viability
    assessment. The five perspectives (task, time, data, system, human) provide orthogonal
    abstraction dimensions for evaluating process activities. Each perspective operates
    at a different abstraction level - from concrete task execution to abstract human
    factors.
- name: Task Perspective Abstraction Hierarchy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:325-344)
    quote: The task perspective refers to the execution of process activities. Its
      criteria are standardization, maturity, determinism, and failure rate
  description: 'Within the task perspective, four criteria form an abstraction hierarchy:
    standardization (structural abstraction of process flow), maturity (temporal abstraction
    of process stability), determinism (behavioral abstraction of rule-based execution),
    and failure rate (operational abstraction of deviation frequency). This shows
    nested abstraction levels within a domain-level framework.'
- name: System vs Human Abstraction Separation

    quote: The fourth perspective in the framework is related to the underlying systems...
      The last perspective deals with humans computer interaction focusing on the
      human
  description: The framework separates system-level abstraction (interfaces, stability,
    number of systems) from human-level abstraction (resources, proneness to human
    error). This demonstrates how RPA viability requires analysis at multiple abstraction
    levels - from technical infrastructure to human behavioral patterns.

  description: 'UFO presents a foundational three-level abstraction architecture:
    UFO-A (structural/endurant foundation), UFO-B (temporal/perdurant extension),

    quote: we needed a Four-Category Ontology. We needed particularized properties
      not only because they were of great importance in making sense of language and
      cognition
  description: The Four-Category Ontology (individuals, universals, substantial individuals,
    accidents) represents a foundational abstraction level that distinguishes between
    things and their properties, particulars and universals. This Aristotelian Square
    provides the metaphysical foundation for higher-level conceptual modeling abstractions.
- name: Conceptual Modeling Language Abstraction Purpose
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:113-118)
    quote: Conceptual Modeling is about representing aspects of the physical and social
      world for the purpose of understanding and communication... the contribution
      of a conceptual modeling notation rests in its ability to promote understanding
  description: 'This defines the purpose of conceptual modeling abstraction: to represent
    reality at a level that promotes human understanding and communication. The abstraction
    level chosen must balance formal rigor with cognitive accessibility, making it
    a domain-level abstraction serving application-level communication needs.'

      2.0 fragment of class diagrams... the worldview embedded in the language through
      its conceptual primitives should be isomorphic to UFO-A
  description: OntoUML represents a domain-level abstraction that bridges foundational
    ontology (UFO-A) and application-level modeling (UML class diagrams). It demonstrates
    how foundational ontological distinctions can be lifted to a domain-level modeling
    language with explicit real-world semantics while maintaining formal syntactic
    constraints.

    quote: we developed the BBO (BPMN 2.0 Based Ontology) ontology for business process
      representation, by reusing existing ontologies and meta-models like BPMN 2.0
  description: BBO represents a domain-level ontology that builds upon a foundational
    meta-model (BPMN 2.0). This demonstrates abstraction layering where domain ontologies
    reuse and extend lower-level foundational structures. The abstraction level is
    'domain' - specific to business process representation while grounded in the BPMN
    2.0 standard.
- name: Ontology Stack Layering with Reuse Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO (Chunk 1:79-81)
    quote: We can benefit from previous formalization initiatives by reusing existing
      ontologies and models rather than developing a new ontology from scratch
  description: Explicit statement of ontology abstraction layering principle. Higher
    abstraction levels (domain ontologies like BBO) should reuse lower abstraction
    levels (foundational meta-models) rather than reinventing base concepts. This
    is a methodological pattern for managing abstraction in ontology engineering.
- name: Fragment Extraction from Comprehensive Meta-model
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO (Chunk 1:90-92)
    quote: The core of BBO is an ontological representation of a fragment extracted
      from the BPMN 2.0 meta-model. Hence, we exploited the process-execution specifications
      of BPMN 2.0
  description: BBO's abstraction approach involves extracting relevant fragments from
    a comprehensive foundational meta-model. This selective extraction creates an
    appropriate abstraction level for the target domain while maintaining semantic
    compatibility with the source meta-model.
- name: Multi-source Ontology Integration at Domain Level
  sources:

    quote: we split BBO model into five fragments according to the five main concepts
      identified in the Specification stage
  description: Domain-level ontologies integrate multiple concept fragments (Process,
    Input/Output, Agent, Work Product, Manufacturing Facility) into a coherent whole.
    This modular approach enables the ontology to maintain appropriate abstraction
    while covering diverse sub-domains.

    quote: We have formalized and implemented the conceptual model of BBO in OWL 2
      DL using Protege. First, we designed and applied a set of conversion rules that
      automatically generated an OWL representation from the UML diagrams
  description: BBO demonstrates abstraction level transformation from conceptual (UML
    class diagrams) to formal (OWL 2 DL). This multi-level representation approach
    allows the same domain knowledge to exist at different abstraction levels for
    different purposes.
- name: Natural Language to Formal Ontology Abstraction

    quote: BPMN 2.0 specification provides a meta-model for BPMN elements as a UML
      class diagram and in the form of an XML schema. However, the diagrams and XML
      schema do not reflect the whole specification... a large part of the specifications
      is in natural language
  description: 'Identifies a critical abstraction gap: formal representations (UML,
    XML) miss semantics expressed in natural language. Full formalization requires
    capturing these informal specifications and encoding them at the formal abstraction
    level. This highlights the challenge of abstraction level completeness.'

      different levels of the ontology class hierarchy. The SD value of BBO is low...
      it means that the ontology is deep (or vertical): it covers a knowledge domain
      in a detailed manner'
  description: Schema Deepness (SD) metric quantifies abstraction depth. Low SD indicates
    a 'deep' ontology with detailed coverage of a specific domain. BBO's SD of 0.78
    positions it as a domain-specific ontology with rich detail rather than a broad
    foundational ontology.

    quote: 'Concepts: 106 | Relationships others than isA: 125 | isA relations: 83'
  description: BBO contains 106 concepts/entities, placing it in the detailed domain
    ontology category. This entity count reflects its position as a comprehensive
    domain-level ontology (comparable to ArchiMate's 57 entities for enterprise architecture).
    The high relationship count (125 non-isA + 83 isA = 208 total) indicates rich
    semantic expressiveness at this abstraction level.
