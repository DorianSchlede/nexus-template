  description: Aggregation is a key graph-enabled transformation that allows merging

  description: The refining transformation enables iterative improvement of a thought
    through self-referential loops in the graph structure. A thought can reference

  description: GoT introduces a novel metric called 'volume' to measure the information
    scope accessible to any given thought. Unlike CoT (linear volume) or ToT (logarithmic
    volume), GoT achieves maximum volume N with logarithmic latency, meaning final
    thoughts can draw from all preceding thoughts in the reasoning graph. This quantifies
    the reasoning capacity advantage of graph-based over linear approaches.

  description: GoT optimizes the fundamental tradeoff between reasoning latency (number
    of steps to reach a conclusion) and volume (scope of information considered).
    Through aggregation, GoT achieves both logarithmic latency and maximum volume,
    outperforming CoT (high latency, high volume), CoT-SC (medium both), and ToT (low

  description: GoT implements a generate-evaluate-select pattern where multiple candidate
    solutions are generated in parallel, each is scored against a quality metric,
    and only the best performing candidates are retained for subsequent operations.

  description: GoT incorporates self-evaluation mechanisms where the LLM assesses
    its own outputs to guide graph expansion decisions. This enables autonomous quality
    control within the reasoning workflow, allowing the system to identify and prioritize
    promising reasoning paths while pruning less valuable branches. Self-evaluation

  description: The Reflection pattern enables agents to critique their own outputs
    for correctness, style, and efficiency, then incorporate this feedback into subsequent
    iterations. It can involve prompting agents to self-evaluate, using external validation
    tools (unit tests, web searches), or distributing critique across multiple agents.

  description: The Planning pattern allows agents to dynamically determine the sequence
    of steps needed to accomplish a larger objective without predefined workflows.
    Agents break down complex tasks into subtasks, enabling flexible decision-making

    agents, improving scalability and adaptability. Frameworks like AutoGen, Crew
    AI, and LangGraph support multi-agent implementations.
- name: Prompt Chaining Workflow Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:620-632)
    quote: Prompt chaining decomposes a complex task into multiple steps, where each
      step builds upon the previous one. This structured approach improves accuracy
      by simplifying each subtask before moving forward
  description: Prompt chaining structures LLM tasks as sequential processing pipelines
    where each step receives output from the previous step as input. This pattern
    is effective when tasks can be broken into fixed subtasks, such as generating
    content then translating it, or creating an outline then verifying then expanding.
    While it improves accuracy through decomposition, it may increase latency due
    to sequential processing.
- name: Routing Workflow Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:647-655)
    quote: Routing involves classifying an input and directing it to an appropriate
      specialized prompt or process. This method ensures distinct queries or tasks
      are handled separately
  description: The Routing pattern classifies incoming inputs and directs them to
    specialized processing pathways optimized for each category. Examples include
    directing customer queries to appropriate departments (technical support, refunds,
    general inquiries) or assigning simple queries to smaller models while complex
    requests go to advanced models. This optimizes efficiency by matching task complexity
    to appropriate resources.
- name: Parallelization Workflow Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:674-685)
    quote: Parallelization divides a task into independent processes that run simultaneously,
      reducing latency and improving throughput. It can be categorized into sectioning
      (independent subtasks) and voting (multiple outputs)
  description: 'Parallelization splits tasks into concurrent independent processes
    to reduce latency. Two sub-patterns exist: sectioning (different models handle
    different aspects, e.g., one screens input while another generates response) and
    voting (multiple models produce outputs for cross-validation, improving confidence
    through consensus). This pattern is applicable when subtasks are independent and
    can benefit from simultaneous execution.'
- name: Orchestrator-Worker Workflow Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:699-709)
    quote: This workflow features a central orchestrator model that dynamically breaks
      tasks into subtasks, assigns them to specialized worker models, and compiles
      the results. Unlike parallelization, it adapts to varying input complexity
  description: The Orchestrator-Worker pattern features a central orchestrating agent
    that dynamically decomposes tasks based on the specific input, assigns subtasks
    to specialized worker agents, and synthesizes their results. Unlike static parallelization,
    it adapts the decomposition to each input's complexity. Applications include automatically
    modifying codebases based on change requests or conducting multi-source real-time
    research.
- name: Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow Pattern
  sources:

    quote: The evaluator-optimizer workflow iteratively improves content by generating
      an initial output and refining it based on feedback from an evaluation model
  description: The Evaluator-Optimizer pattern creates a feedback loop where an initial
    output is generated, then evaluated against quality criteria, and refined based
    on evaluation feedback. This iterative cycle continues until quality thresholds
    are met. Effective when clear evaluation criteria exist, such as improving literary
    translations through multiple cycles or refining research queries through successive
    iterations.

      where a single agent manages the retrieval, routing, and integration of information
  description: 'Single-Agent RAG consolidates all retrieval, routing, and integration
    tasks into one unified agent. The workflow involves: query submission and evaluation,
    knowledge source selection (structured databases, semantic search, web search,
    recommendation systems), data integration and LLM synthesis, and output generation.

      architectures, designed to handle complex workflows by leveraging multiple specialized
      agents
  description: Multi-Agent RAG distributes retrieval and reasoning across specialized
    agents, each optimized for specific data sources or task types. A coordinator
    agent delegates queries to specialized agents (SQL databases, semantic search,
    web search, recommendations), which retrieve in parallel. Results are integrated
    by an LLM for synthesis. This provides modularity, scalability, task specialization,
    and versatility for multi-domain applications.
- name: Hierarchical Agentic RAG Architecture
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 2:100-131)
    quote: Hierarchical Agentic RAG systems employ a structured, multi-tiered approach
      to information retrieval and processing, enhancing both efficiency and strategic
      decision-making
  description: Hierarchical RAG organizes agents in tiers with higher-level agents
    overseeing lower-level ones. Top-tier agents evaluate query complexity and prioritize
    data sources, mid-level agents retrieve from specialized sources, and lower-level
    agents perform specific retrieval tasks. This enables strategic prioritization,
    multi-level decision-making, and scalable handling of complex multi-faceted queries
    through structured delegation.

      enhancing document utilization and improving response generation quality
  description: 'Corrective RAG embeds intelligent agents for iterative refinement:
    Context Retrieval Agent (initial retrieval), Relevance Evaluation Agent (assesses
    document relevance), Query Refinement Agent (rewrites queries for better results),
    External Knowledge Retrieval Agent (supplements with web search when context insufficient),
    and Response Synthesis Agent (produces final output). This ensures iterative correction
    and minimizes errors.'
- name: Adaptive RAG with Dynamic Strategy Selection
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 2:317-398)
    quote: Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Adaptive RAG) enhances flexibility
      and efficiency by dynamically adjusting query handling strategies based on the
      complexity of the incoming query
  description: 'Adaptive RAG uses a classifier to assess query complexity and select
    appropriate strategies: straightforward queries bypass retrieval and use direct
    generation, simple queries use single-step retrieval, complex queries activate
    multi-step retrieval with iterative refinement. A smaller language model classifies
    queries while the main LLM synthesizes responses. This optimizes both computational
    efficiency and response accuracy by matching resources to query demands.'
