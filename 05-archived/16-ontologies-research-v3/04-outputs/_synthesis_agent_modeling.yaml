- name: Agent as Autonomous Performer
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:52-53)
    quote: agentic workflows, where autonomous agents make decisions, plan tasks,
      and coordinate with humans and other agents
  description: UFO positions agents as autonomous entities capable of decision-making,
    task planning, and coordination. This aligns with the BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions)
    model where agents have intentional states that drive their behavior. Agents are
    not passive - they actively steer workflows.
- name: Four-Category Ontology for Agent Foundation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:116-117)
    quote: UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling
      notions via a set of micro-theories
  description: UFO's four-category structure (individuals, types, substantials, moments)
    provides the ontological foundation for agent modeling. Agents are modeled as
    substantials (independent endurants) that can bear moments (properties like intentions,
    beliefs, capabilities).
- name: Role as Anti-Rigid Agent Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:376-377)
    quote: roles whose contingent classification conditions are relational, termed
      roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator)
  description: Agents are classified into roles based on relational conditions. A
    person becomes an 'employee' agent when participating in an employment relator.
    This role-based agent modeling enables context-sensitive agent behavior where
    the same entity can act in different capacities.
- name: Modes as Agent Internal States
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-322)
    quote: Modes can bear their own moments, including their own qualities, which
      can vary in independent ways. The category of modes include dispositions (e.g.,
      functions, capabilities, capacities, vulnerabilities)
  description: Agent internal states are modeled as modes - intrinsic moments that
    inhere in agents. Dispositions like capabilities, intentions, and functions are
    modes that define what an agent can do and intends to do. This enables modeling
    agent competencies and intentions.
- name: Externally Dependent Mode for Agent Relationships
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:322-324)
    quote: as well as externally dependent entities (e.g., the love of John for Mary,
      the commitment of Paul towards Clara to meet for lunch next Friday)
  description: Agents have externally dependent modes that model their relational
    states - commitments, obligations, and directed attitudes toward other agents.
    This pattern captures how agents maintain directed intentional states toward other
    entities.
- name: Qua-Individual for Agent-in-Role
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-328)
    quote: a qua individual, which is a mode composed of other externally dependent
      modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and
      the same foundational event
  description: The qua-individual pattern models agents-in-roles as complex modes.
    'John-qua-husband-of-Mary' represents all of John's commitments and claims in
    that specific role context. This enables modeling how a single agent can simultaneously
    occupy multiple roles with distinct responsibilities.
- name: Relator as Agent Binding Mechanism
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:329-332)
    quote: a relator is a moment (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is
      an aggregation of qua individuals... Examples of relators include marriages,
      enrollments, employments, contracts
  description: Relators bind agents together through reciprocal qua-individuals. An
    employment relator binds employer and employee agents, with each agent having
    role-specific commitments. This pattern is fundamental for modeling multi-agent
    relationships and organizational structures.
- name: Agent Participation in Events
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:295-296)
    quote: An endurant then participates in a perdurant if that perdurant has a part
      that is a manifestation of a disposition inhering in that endurant
  description: Agents participate in events through their dispositions. When an agent's
    capability disposition is manifested, the agent participates in the resulting
    event. This causally grounds agent participation in activities through their inherent
    capabilities and intentions.
- name: Endurant-Perdurant Distinction for Agent Identity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-288)
    quote: UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between
      endurants (e.g., Mick Jagger, the Moon) and perdurants... Endurants are individuals
      that exist in time with all their parts
  description: Agents are endurants - entities that persist through time maintaining
    identity despite changes. Unlike events/activities, agents can qualitatively change
    (gaining skills, changing intentions) while remaining the same agent. This grounds
    agent identity and persistence.
- name: Object Kind as Agent Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:360-361)
    quote: Objects (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated
      functional roles with respect to the whole (Guizzardi, 2009), e.g, a human body,
      an organization, a computer
  description: Complex agents like organizations are modeled as functional complexes
    - objects whose parts (sub-agents, roles) play differentiated functional roles.
    This enables modeling organizational agents with internal structure and role differentiation.
- name: Walker as Role-Playing Agent
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:129-136)
    quote: Jogger is a role played by a Person when bearing a Jog mode (an endurant
      comprising an intention as well as the capacities of the person as a Jogger)
  description: Agents take on roles when they bear specific modes (intentions + capacities).
    A person becomes a Jogger agent when they bear the Jog mode. This pattern shows
    how roles emerge from the agent's internal intentional and dispositional states,
    not just external relationships.
- name: Agent External Dependence
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:146)
    quote: 'x :: Jog -> exists!y. (y :: JoggingTrack ^ externallyDependent(x, y))'
  description: Agent modes can be externally dependent on environmental entities.
    A Jog mode is externally dependent on a JoggingTrack. This captures how agent
    intentions and activities are directed toward and dependent on external objects
    in the environment.
- name: Intention-Based Agent Mode
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:258-260)
    quote: what genuinely changes is the complex mode (including an intentional component)
      inhering in the Walker. Due to a change in the intention of the walker, a different
      walking perdurant will be manifested
  description: Agent behavior changes stem from changes in intentional modes. When
    a walker's intention changes, their subsequent activities change. This BDI-aligned
    pattern shows intentions as causal drivers of agent behavior manifestation.
- name: Redirected Intention Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:335-339)
    quote: In the case of a Redirected Walk, there is a new intention, which is aggregated
      to the original walk and which is directed (again, externally dependent on)
      a new destination
  description: Agents can modify their goals mid-execution by acquiring new intentions.
    The pattern shows how a new intention mode can be added to an existing complex
    mode, redirecting agent behavior toward a new goal while maintaining continuity
    of the original activity.
- name: Spouse Role Pattern for Multi-Agent Binding
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:451-457)
    quote: 'Role(Spouse), Spouse < Person, x :: Spouse -> exists y. (y :: ConjugalRelationship
      ^ mediates(y, x))'
  description: Role-based agent modeling where the Spouse role is played by Person
    agents when mediated by a ConjugalRelationship relator. This pattern shows how
    agents are bound into social relationships through mediating relators.
- name: AI Agent as W3C PROV Agent Extension
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-280)
    quote: We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass,
      enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader
      workflow provenance graph
  description: AI agents are modeled as a subclass of the W3C PROV Agent concept.
    This enables AI agents to be first-class citizens in provenance graphs, with their
    actions, decisions, and interactions fully traceable alongside traditional workflow
    components.
- name: Agent Tool Execution Model
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-291)
    quote: an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool)
      and each tool may be informed by (PROV wasInformedBy) one or many AIModelInvocations
  description: AI agents are modeled as having tool capabilities they can execute.
    Each agent tool execution is an activity that may invoke AI models and produce
    responses. This separates the agent entity from its actions, enabling fine-grained
    provenance tracking.
- name: Agent Attribution for Outputs
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:291-292)
    quote: generates a ResponseData object, which is attributedTo the corresponding
      agent
  description: Agent outputs and decisions are explicitly attributed to the agent
    that generated them using the PROV wasAttributedTo relationship. This creates
    accountability chains linking outputs to their responsible agents, essential for
    tracing hallucinations and errors.
- name: Agent as Material Entity with Role Realization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:654-669)
    quote: PROV Agent is mapped as a subclass of BFO material entities that both participate
      in some PROV Activity and bear some BFO role that is realized in a PROV Activity
  description: 'Agents are ontologically grounded as material entities with two key
    characteristics: (1) participation in activities and (2) bearing roles that get
    realized through activities. This dual requirement establishes agents as physical
    beings with social/functional aspects expressed through role-bearing.'
- name: Agent Responsibility through Role-Bearing
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:659-668)
    quote: The definition of PROV Agent also states that an agent bears some form
      of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity,
      or another agent's activity
  description: Responsibility is formalized through the role-bearing relation. Every
    PROV Agent bears some role realized in some PROV Activity, capturing the notion
    that agents are responsible actors. The open-world interpretation means agent
    data need not include activity data, but the existence of related activities is
    asserted.
- name: Software Agent as Material Realization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:656-659)
    quote: every particular instance of a PROV SoftwareAgent is a material realization
      of some software (which may itself be considered a generically dependent continuant)
  description: Software agents are modeled as material entities because they have
    physical instantiation. The software itself is a generically dependent continuant
    (can exist in multiple copies), but any running software agent instance is a material
    realization. This grounds AI agents ontologically as physical processes.
- name: Agent-Entity Compatibility
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:666-668)
    quote: According to Requirement VI3 in 'The Rationale of Prov', a PROV Agent could
      be a PROV Entity and this is possible in our mapping because both PROV Agent
      and PROV Entity are subclasses of BFO continuant
  description: The ontology allows agents to also be entities (things that can be
    used, generated, influenced). Both are continuants in BFO, enabling flexible modeling
    where the same thing can act as an agent in one context and be acted upon as an
    entity in another.
- name: CCO Agent Equivalence with Activity Participation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:676-679)
    quote: A PROV Agent is equivalent to the intersection of CCO agents that are a
      CCO agent in some PROV Activity
  description: The Common Core Ontologies provide a more specific equivalence mapping
    for agents. A PROV Agent equals the intersection of CCO agents that participate
    in activities. This enables richer reasoning for BFO/CCO users while maintaining
    compatibility with the base PROV model.
- name: Activity-Agent Participation Asymmetry
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:686-691)
    quote: although all instances of PROV Agent are participants in some PROV Activity
      at some time, not all instances of PROV Activity have participants
  description: 'While every agent must participate in some activity (defining characteristic
    of agency), activities can exist without participants. This asymmetry is important
    for modeling: agency requires activity involvement, but activities are not defined
    by having agents.'
- name: Agent-Activity Disjointness Decision
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:710-720)
    quote: Mapping PROV Agent to BFO continuant and PROV Activity to BFO process implies
      that PROV Agent is disjoint with PROV Activity. While this contradicts Requirement
      V14, it does not contradict any specific example
  description: 'A key ontological commitment: agents and activities are fundamentally
    different types (continuants vs occurrents). While PROV-O technically allows agents
    to be activities, the BFO mapping enforces disjointness based on the philosophical
    distinction between things that persist and things that happen.'
- name: Agent Activity Relationship via wasAssociatedWith
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 1:758-764)
    quote: PROV wasAssociatedWith has domain PROV Activity and range PROV Agent...
      This object property is mapped as a subproperty of BFO has participant
  description: The wasAssociatedWith relation formally links activities to their agents.
    It maps to BFO has_participant (inverse of participates_in) and CCO has_agent.
    This provides the core mechanism for associating agents with the activities they
    perform.
- name: PROV Role as Externally Determined
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 2:103-113)
    quote: PROV Role is defined as 'the function of an entity or agent with respect
      to an activity'... we map PROV Role directly as a subclass of BFO role on the
      grounds that a PROV Role is externally determined by the context
  description: Roles in agent modeling are distinguished from functions. While PROV
    uses 'function' terminology, the mapping recognizes roles as externally determined
    (by context of usage/generation/association), not internally grounded in physical
    makeup. Roles can be gained/lost without physical change.
- name: Influence as Process Not Capacity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 2:43-50)
    quote: the dependent nature of PROV influences is better explained by classifying
      these as BFO processes or process boundaries that depend on agents through relations
      such as BFO has participant
  description: Agent influence is modeled as a process (occurrence), not a capacity
    (disposition). Influences depend on agents through participation, but they are
    events in time, not inherent capabilities. This reframes agency from 'having capacities'
    to 'participating in influencing processes'.
- name: Agent Influence Tripartite Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 04-PROV-O_to_BFO_Semantic_Mapping (Chunk 2:85-90)
    quote: PROV-O further divides PROV Influence into 3 direct subclasses - PROV EntityInfluence,
      PROV ActivityInfluence, PROV AgentInfluence - according to a trisection of influencers
  description: 'Influences are classified by their source type: entity influence,
    activity influence, or agent influence. This provides a mechanism to distinguish
    different kinds of causal relationships based on whether the influencer is a thing,
    a process, or an agent.'
- name: Endurant-Perdurant Participation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:134-137)
    quote: An endurant can be in time by participating in a perdurant, and perdurants
      happen in time by having endurants as participants. For instance, a person is
      in time by participating to her own life
  description: DOLCE models agents (as endurants/physical objects) as existing in
    time through participation in events/processes. A person exists through participating
    in their life. This participation relation is the fundamental link between agents
    and activities.
- name: Agentive Physical Object Category
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:751-752)
    quote: 'The DOLCE categories that we need for modeling this case are: agentive
      physical object (APO), non-agentive social object (NASO), and Time (T)'
  description: DOLCE provides an explicit 'Agentive Physical Object' (APO) category
    for modeling agents. This distinguishes entities capable of agency from non-agentive
    objects and social objects (like roles and concepts). Persons are classified as
    APO.
- name: Role as Anti-Rigid Founded Concept
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:186-189)
    quote: Roles are represented as (social) concepts, which are connected to other
      entities... roles are concepts that are anti-rigid and founded, meaning that
      (i) they have dynamic properties and (ii) they have a relational nature
  description: 'Roles in agent modeling have two key meta-properties: anti-rigidity
    (can be acquired/lost) and foundedness (depend on external relations). This captures
    how teacher, student, or employee roles are dynamic, context-dependent classifications
    of agents.'
- name: Classification Relation for Role Assignment
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:405-408)
    quote: CF(x, y, t) stands for 'at the time t, x is classified by the concept y'
  description: Role assignment uses a temporal classification relation. An agent x
    is classified by role y at time t. This three-place relation enables modeling
    of role acquisition and loss over time, essential for dynamic agent behavior.
- name: Functional vs Non-Functional Roles
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:777,792)
    quote: Funct_RL(y) ^ CF(x, y, t) ^ CF(x', y, t) -> x = x' ... Formula (12) states
      that a functional role (y) can classify only one entity at each time
  description: Roles can be functional (only one holder at a time, like 'teacher of
    class 2C') or non-functional (multiple holders, like 'student of class 2C'). This
    distinction is crucial for modeling organizational and social agent arrangements.
- name: Constant vs Temporal Participation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:369-370)
    quote: We also introduce the relation of constant participation (PCC), cf. (d10),
      i.e., participation during the whole perdurant
  description: DOLCE distinguishes constant participation (agent present throughout
    entire activity) from temporal participation (agent present at specific times).
    This enables fine-grained modeling of when agents are involved in processes.
- name: Role as Externally-Grounded Realizable
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:268-275)
    quote: A role is a realizable entity which exists because the bearer is in some
      special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances in which the
      bearer does not have to be
  description: 'Roles are externally grounded: they exist due to external circumstances,
    not internal physical makeup. An agent can lose a role without physical change.
    This distinguishes roles from dispositions and functions which are internally
    grounded.'
- name: Having vs Playing a Role
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:309-312)
    quote: There is also a distinction between having a role and playing a role. An
      entity can play a role... but neither the person nor the pyramidal neuron have
      those roles
  description: 'Critical distinction for agent modeling: an agent can PLAY a role
    (temporarily fill it) without HAVING it (being the proper role-holder). A passenger
    can play pilot in emergency without having that role. This enables modeling of
    temporary vs permanent role assignments.'
- name: Role Optionality vs Disposition Necessity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:288,337-339)
    quote: Roles are optional. A person can lose the role of student without being
      physically changed... Unlike roles, dispositions are not optional. If an entity
      is a certain way, then it has a certain disposition
  description: Roles are contingent and can be gained/lost without physical change.
    Dispositions are necessary given physical makeup. This ontological distinction
    is critical for modeling agent capabilities (dispositions) vs agent assignments
    (roles).
- name: Function as Internally-Grounded Realizable
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:385-396)
    quote: A function is a disposition that exists in virtue of the bearer's physical
      make-up, and this physical make-up is something the bearer possesses because
      it came into being, either through evolution or through intentional design
  description: Functions are dispositions arising from physical structure via evolution
    (biological) or design (artifactual). Unlike roles which are externally assigned,
    functions are inherent to the agent's construction. AI agents have functions by
    design.
- name: Biological vs Artifactual Function
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:429,449-451)
    quote: An artifactual function is a function whose bearer's physical make-up has
      been designed and made intentionally... A biological function is a function
      whose bearer is part of an organism
  description: Functions split into artifactual (designed, like AI agent functions)
    and biological (evolved, like organ functions). This grounds AI agent capabilities
    in the artifactual function category - they have functions because they were designed
    to have them.
- name: Realizable Entity and Process Realization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:222-226,241-243)
    quote: a screwdriver's function is realized in the actual process of turning a
      screw... A realizable entity is defined as a specifically dependent continuant
      that has an independent continuant entity as its bearer, and whose instances
      can be realized in associated processes
  description: Functions, roles, and dispositions are realized (manifested, executed)
    in processes. An agent's capabilities are realized when they perform activities.
    This provides the formal link between agent properties (realizables) and agent
    behavior (processes).
- name: Object-Centric Multi-Object Events
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:149-154)
    quote: 'Events: Object-centric process mining works on discrete events... Every
      event is unique and corresponds to a specific action or observation at a specific
      point in time. Events are atomic, have a timestamp, and may have additional
      attributes'
  description: In OCEL 2.0, events can relate to multiple objects (including human
    agents, systems, etc.). This overcomes single-case limitations, enabling modeling
    of activities involving multiple participants/agents without flattening. Events
    are atomic with timestamps.
- name: Event-to-Object Qualified Relationships
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:178-185)
    quote: Events are associated with objects... In contrast to traditional event
      logs, events can be related to multiple objects. Furthermore, these relationships
      can be qualified differently, describing the role an object plays in the occurrence
      of this specific event
  description: OCEL 2.0 qualifies event-to-object relationships with role descriptors.
    In a meeting event, qualifiers distinguish organizer from participants. This enables
    rich modeling of how different agents/objects participate in activities with specific
    roles.
- name: Actor as Organizational Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:83-86)
    quote: This process relies on 7 different types of entities. Actors (human workers)
      and machines (an automated warehouse) together handle 5 types of objects
  description: Actors are modeled as one of the core entity types in process execution,
    distinguished from machines and objects. Human workers (Actors) are organizational
    entities that execute the process alongside automated systems. This represents
    a basic agent classification separating human agents from automated agents.
- name: Resource Entity Inference
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:233-234)
    quote: we can consider Table 1 is an event table with entity types ENT = {Resource,
      Order, Supplier Order, Item, Invoice, Payment}
  description: Resource is explicitly identified as an entity type in event data,
    representing actors/agents that perform activities. This shows how agents are
    modeled as first-class entities in event knowledge graphs, correlated to events
    through entity type attributes.
- name: Actor Entity Inference from Events
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:595-604)
    quote: Workers are performing this actual work. Often called 'resources' in process
      management literature, we prefer the term Actor used in organizations research,
      as each actor follows its own behavior
  description: Agents are modeled as Actor entities with autonomous behavior patterns.
    The paper explicitly distinguishes Actor from Resource terminology, emphasizing
    that each actor has individual behavioral characteristics. Actors are inferred
    from event data and their df-paths reveal unique behavioral patterns.
- name: Actor Behavioral df-paths
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:604-608)
    quote: To study actor behavior in the graph of Fig. 6, we only have to (1) infer
      the Actor entities from the event nodes (see Table 1), and (2) infer each actor's
      df-path
  description: Agent modeling involves constructing directly-follows paths for each
    actor entity. These df-paths capture the sequential behavior of individual agents
    across different process entities, enabling analysis of how specific workers execute
    activities over time.
- name: Actor Intertwined Work Patterns
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:605-607)
    quote: We can see actors R1, R2, R3 working 'intertwined' in the same part of
      the process. In contrast, R4 and R5 work more separated from the other actors
  description: Agents exhibit different collaboration patterns that can be discovered
    from event data. Some agents work intertwined on shared process areas while others
    work in isolation. This reveals organizational patterns of agent collaboration
    and specialization.
- name: Agent Specialization Patterns
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:150-152)
    quote: individual Actors (R1, ..., R5) are specialized in specific activities
      across multiple different entities, e.g., R2 specializes receiving, updating,
      and unpacking Supplier Orders and handling Items
  description: Agents exhibit specialization behaviors where individual actors focus
    on specific activity types across multiple entity instances. This represents role-based
    agent modeling where agents have defined competencies and responsibilities.

  description: BBO models agents with a fundamental type distinction between HumanResource
    and SoftwareResource. This binary categorization acknowledges that both human

      Activities.
  description: BBO introduces a nuanced model separating Job (organizational position)

- name: Direct vs Indirect Agent Assignment

    quote: For a given Activity, we may assign a specific Agent (i.e., direct assignment),
      or a Role (i.e., indirect assignment). In the case of indirect assignment, all
      agents playing the assigned role are potential performers of the Activity.
  description: 'BBO supports two agent assignment patterns: direct (explicit agent
    instance) and indirect (via role). Direct assignment binds a specific agent to
    an activity. Indirect assignment creates a pool of potential performers - any
    agent with the required role can execute the activity. This pattern enables both
    rigid and flexible workflow assignments.'

    from software process management literature. This indicates that agent modeling
    patterns are transferable across domains (software management to industrial BPM).
    The reuse pattern validates agent concepts as stable, domain-independent constructs.
- name: Resource-Agent Semantic Ambiguity in BPMN
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:290-293)
    quote: The Resource concept exists in the BPMN meta-model. However, its semantics
      and definition are ambiguous. Indeed, on p. 95 of BPMN specification, the Resource
      class is supposed to cover all resource types. However, the definition of the
      relation that assigns resources to a process (p. 148) or an activity (p.152),
      limits the set of resources to the agents responsible for performing the work.
  description: BBO identifies a fundamental semantic ambiguity in BPMN where 'Resource'
    oscillates between meaning 'any resource type' and specifically 'agents/performers'.
    This conflation of agents with generic resources is a common ontological pitfall.
    BBO resolves this by adopting the broader definition where Resource encompasses
    all types, while Agent becomes a specific subtype. This clarifies that agents
    are a specialized form of resource with performer capabilities.
- name: Agent-Activity Performance Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:299)
    quote: Indeed, in (Awad et al., 2009; Stroppi, Chiotti and Villarreal, 2011) Resource
      in BPMN is equivalent to Agents.
  description: Literature review confirms that in BPMN contexts, Resource is often
    equated with Agent - the entity that performs work. This equivalence pattern appears
    in multiple BPM works, suggesting a strong conceptual link between resource allocation
    and agent assignment in process modeling. The performer relationship is central
    to how agents are conceived in BPM ontologies.
- name: Virtual Agent as Process Assistant
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:77-78)
    quote: Once populated with BP data, the ontology forms a knowledge base (KB) that
      will be exploited by a virtual agent to support operators in the execution of
      BP step-by-step. It will also provide answers to operators' questions about
      the process execution.
  description: 'BBO envisions AI/virtual agents as consumers of the ontology, not
    just modeled entities within it. The virtual agent uses the populated knowledge
    base to guide human operators through process execution and answer questions.
    This represents a meta-level of agent modeling: AI agents that reason over ontologies
    containing human agent definitions to orchestrate human work.'
