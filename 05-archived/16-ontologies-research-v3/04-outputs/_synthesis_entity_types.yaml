- name: Endurant-Perdurant Dichotomy
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-288)
    quote: UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between
      endurants and perdurants, as opposed to a 4D ontology in which all concrete
      individuals are perdurants
  description: The most fundamental entity type distinction in UFO. Endurants exist
    in time with all their parts and can qualitatively change while maintaining identity.
    Perdurants unfold in time accumulating temporal parts. This maps to the 8-entity
    hypothesis where Events are perdurants and most other entities (Agent, Resource,
    Data, Role) are endurants.
- name: Endurant Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:285-288)
    quote: Endurants are individuals that exist in time with all their parts. They
      have essential and accidental properties and, hence, they can qualitatively
      change while maintaining their numerical identity
  description: Core entity type definition. Endurants can change properties while
    remaining the same individual. The unique Kind they instantiate defines what changes
    are permissible. This supports modeling Agents, Resources, Roles as entities that
    persist through change.
- name: Perdurant Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:289-296)
    quote: Perdurants are individuals that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts.
      They are manifestations of dispositions and only exist in the past. As such,
      perdurants are modally fragile
  description: Events in the 8-entity hypothesis correspond to perdurants. They cannot
    change - any apparent change is variation between temporal parts or change in
    underlying endurants. Events are founded on dispositions inhering in endurants.
- name: Substantial vs Moment Partition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:297-301)
    quote: UFO is an ontology based of the so-called Aristotelian Square, thus, accounting
      for both substantial individuals (or Substantials), i.e., independent entities,
      as well as particularized properties, i.e., existentially dependent entities
      or moments
  description: Endurants partition into Substantials (independent, e.g., Mick Jagger,
    an organization) and Moments (existentially dependent, e.g., a headache, a marriage).
    This is the Aristotelian Square four-category ontology structure.
- name: Object Entity Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:360-361)
    quote: Objects (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated
      functional roles with respect to the whole, e.g, a human body, an organization,
      a computer
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:489-491)

    quote: Context Utilization might involve the creation or modification of Artefacts.
      Beyond mere artefact manipulation, this utilization can manifest as external
      Impact, such as initiating external processes
  description: Merged from 4 sources. Objects are substantials with parts that have
    distinct functional roles. Maps to Agent (organizations are objects), Resource
    (computers, tools are objects). Unity comes from functional integration of parts.
- name: Collective Entity Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:356-358)
    quote: Collectives are entities whose parts play the same role with respect to
      the whole, e.g., the Black Forest (as a collective of trees), a deck of cards,
      the Dutch-speaking group
  description: Collectives are substantials whose parts are homogeneous in role. Could
    model teams, groups of agents, resource pools. Distinct from Objects where parts
    have differentiated roles.
- name: Quantity Entity Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:353-354)
    quote: Quantities are maximally-topologically-self-connected (e.g., pieces) of

      of sand
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:205-207)

    quote: For example, if we pick the Activity property as 'entity identifier', we
      infer entities such as Receive SO, Unpack, Scan, Store, Retrieve, Pack Shipment...
  description: Merged from 3 sources. Activity can be treated as an entity type by
    using the Activity property as an entity identifier. This reveals queues between
    activities as entities that other objects pass through.
- name: Intrinsic Moment - Quality
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:302-306)
    quote: Intrinsic moments are existentially dependent on a single individual. These

      height, weight, electrical charge
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-323)
    quote: Modes can bear their own moments, including their own qualities, which
      can vary in independent ways. The category of modes include dispositions (e.g.,
      functions, capabilities, capacities, vulnerabilities)
  description: Merged from 2 sources. Modes are intrinsic moments that cannot be directly
    projected to values but can bear other moments. Dispositions are key mode subtype
    - functions, capabilities map to what Agents and Resources can do.
- name: Externally Dependent Mode
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:322-326)
    quote: Externally dependent modes inhere in an entity while being externally dependent
      on another entity. A particularly interesting type of externally dependent mode
      is a qua individual
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 2:189-196)
    quote: a mode x that is existentially dependent on an entity that is independent
      of the bearer of x... ExternallyDependentMode(x) iff Mode(x) and exists y such
      that externallyDependent(x, y)
  description: 'Merged from 2 sources. Modes that depend on entities other than their

      composed of John-qua-husband-of-Mary and Mary-qua-wife-of-John
  - chunk_ref: 23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:132-133)
    quote: particularized relations (relationships) and particularized intrinsic properties
      (e.g., often represented by the so-called weak entities) are frequently modeled
      as bearers of other particularized properties
  description: 'Merged from 2 sources. Relators are aggregations of qua individuals
    sharing a foundational event. Examples: marriages, enrollments, employments, contracts,
    presidential mandates. Critical for modeling relationships between Agents, Roles,
    and Resources in the 8-entity hypothesis.'
- name: Qua Individual
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-328)
    quote: a qua individual is a mode composed of other externally dependent modes
      that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and the
      same foundational event
  description: Qua individuals aggregate externally dependent modes with common bearer
    and foundation. John-qua-husband-of-Mary bundles all John's conjugal commitments
    to Mary from their wedding. Models role-based identity aspects.
- name: Kind Entity Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:368-369)

      of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:375-377)
    quote: sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational, termed
      roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator,
      and husband as a role of a person)
  - chunk_ref: 31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:350-353)

      Tools... Communication Tools
  - chunk_ref: 18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 2:127-144)
    quote: 'Data types in multi-agent architectures encompass: Structured Text Data...
      Unstructured Text Data... Multimodal Data... Domain-specific Data'
  description: Merged from 9 sources. Kinds provide identity criteria - what makes
    an individual the same over time. Person, dog, computer, car, organization, marriage
    are kinds. Each endurant instantiates exactly one kind. Foundational for typing
    Agents, Resources, Roles.
- name: Sortal Entity Type
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:369-372)

      of dengue fever)

    quote: Often called 'resources' in process management literature, we prefer the
      term Actor used in organizations research, as each actor follows its own behavior.
  description: Merged from 6 sources. Event is defined as an occurrence that happens
    during process execution, affecting flow and requiring reactions. This directly
