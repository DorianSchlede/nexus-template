    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:773-776)"
    quote: "We map PROV Person as equivalent to the intersection of CCO Person and PROV Agent. This entails that every PROV Person is both a CCO Person and PROV Agent"

    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:269-275)"
    quote: "A role is a realizable entity which exists because the bearer is in some special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances...not such that, if it ceases to exist, then the physical make-up of the bearer is thereby changed"

    description: "Biological functions are attributed to parts of organisms, not whole organisms. Hearts have functions; organisms have roles. This captures the proper level of functional attribution."

    description: "Playing a role is temporary/contextual; having a role implies genuine bearer status. A passenger playing pilot doesn't have the pilot role. This distinguishes temporary performance from role bearing."
