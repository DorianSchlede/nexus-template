  # Paper 16: KG-Agent Knowledge Graph Reasoning
  - name: "Multi-level KG Toolbox Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:238-259)"
    quote: "we design three types of tools for LLMs reasoning over KG, i.e., extraction, semantic, and logic tools"
    description: "The paper presents a hierarchical tool abstraction for KG reasoning at three levels: (1) Extraction tools for low-level data access (get_relation, get_entity), (2) Logic tools for intermediate manipulation (count, intersect, union), and (3) Semantic tools for high-level understanding (relation retrieval, entity disambiguation). This represents a domain/application abstraction layer designed for practical agent-KG interaction."

  - name: "Autonomous Agent Framework Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:83-89)"
    quote: "designing autonomous reasoning approaches that can actively make decisions during reasoning, without human assistance"
    description: "KG-Agent operates at an application abstraction level, providing autonomous decision-making capabilities for complex reasoning without pre-defined interaction mechanisms. The framework abstracts away the complexity of KG traversal into an agent-controllable interface, representing an applied/practical level of ontological abstraction for agent-knowledge integration."

  - name: "Program Language Formulation for Multi-hop Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:31-33)"
    quote: "we leverage program language to formulate the multi-hop reasoning process over the KG"
    description: "The paper uses program language (code-based instructions) as an abstraction mechanism to represent multi-hop reasoning chains over knowledge graphs. This creates a bridge between high-level reasoning goals and low-level KG operations, serving as an intermediate abstraction layer that enables instruction tuning for smaller LLMs."

  # Paper 17: KG Reasoning with Logics and Embeddings Survey
  - name: "Three Integration Stages Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning (Chunk 1:136-141)"
    quote: "three stages: 1) Pre: conducting symbolic reasoning before learning embeddings. 2) Joint: injecting the logics during embedding learning. 3) Post: conducting symbolic reasoning after embeddings are learned"
    description: "The survey identifies three abstraction levels for integrating logics with embeddings based on temporal staging: pre-training (data preparation level), joint training (model integration level), and post-training (inference level). This temporal abstraction helps categorize different approaches to neural-symbolic integration in KG reasoning."

  - name: "Logic Types Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning (Chunk 1:124-128)"
    quote: "We consider two mainstream logic forms used in KG reasoning: (1) logic rules and (2) Ontological schema, such as those supported by OWL 2"
    description: "The paper distinguishes between two levels of logic abstraction: (1) Logic rules representing specific inference patterns at a domain level, and (2) Ontological schemas (OWL 2) representing foundational/core level constraints. This hierarchy reflects the relationship between foundational ontology languages and domain-specific rule systems."

  - name: "Foundational vs Domain KG Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning (Chunk 1:36-39)"
    quote: "Knowledge graph (KG), representing facts in the form of triples, with vocabulary defined in a schema (also known as ontology)"
    description: "The paper positions KGs at a domain/application abstraction level where facts are represented as triples with schemas providing the foundational vocabulary. This places KG reasoning in the middle of the ontology stack - above foundational ontologies but below specific application implementations."

  - name: "Class and Relation Hierarchy Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning (Chunk 1:200-234)"
    quote: "Class hierarchies classify entity types, denoting entities as instantiations of classes... Relation hierarchies contain subsumption relationships between relations"
    description: "The survey describes ontological schema components at two abstraction levels: class hierarchies (entity type abstraction) and relation hierarchies (relationship type abstraction). Both operate at the domain/core ontology level to organize knowledge structure through taxonomic relationships."

  - name: "Hybrid vs Neural Mechanism Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning (Chunk 1:350-351)"
    quote: "1) Hybrid: after applying embeddings, methods still infer in a symbolic space. 2) Neural: using embeddings following the process of logic reasoning, and all inferences are conducted in vector space"
    description: "The paper distinguishes two abstraction mechanisms for combining embeddings with logic: hybrid approaches that maintain symbolic abstraction layers, and purely neural approaches that translate all reasoning into vector space. This represents different levels of abstraction in neural-symbolic integration."

  # Paper 18: Multi-Agent Architecture Taxonomy
  - name: "Multi-dimensional Taxonomy with Three Autonomy Levels"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 1:166-168)"
    quote: "ranging from systems that strictly adhere to predefined mechanisms (rule-driven automation, L0/L0) to those that dynamically adapt in real-time, guided by evolving conditions and user feedback (user-responsive autonomy, L2/L2)"
    description: "The taxonomy presents a three-level abstraction for autonomy in LLM multi-agent systems: L0 (static/rule-driven), L1 (adaptive within frameworks), L2 (self-organizing). This abstraction hierarchy enables systematic classification of how agents balance independence vs constraints at different architectural levels."

  - name: "Four Architectural Viewpoints Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 1:172-175)"
    quote: "applied to multiple distinct architectural viewpoints, such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction"
    description: "The paper introduces four abstraction viewpoints for analyzing multi-agent systems: (1) functional viewpoint (goal-driven task management), (2) development viewpoint (agent composition), (3) process viewpoint (multi-agent collaboration), (4) physical viewpoint (context interaction). These viewpoints enable multi-level architectural analysis at different abstraction layers."

  - name: "Domain-Ontology Model for Agent Architectures"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 1:185-187)"
    quote: "a domain-ontology model represented as a UML class diagram structuring the architectural concepts and their interrelations relevant for our taxonomy"
    description: "The paper proposes a domain-ontology model at the domain/application abstraction level for LLM multi-agent systems. This conceptual model abstracts architectural concepts into a structured representation, positioning it between foundational software engineering concepts and specific system implementations."

  - name: "108 Single Configuration Options Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 2:107-111)"
    quote: "mapping the autonomy-alignment matrix onto the identified aspects, our taxonomy captures 108 distinct single configuration options... 9^12 ≈ 282 billion combinations"
    description: "The taxonomy's 12 architectural aspects across 9 autonomy-alignment configurations create a highly granular abstraction space with 108 single options. This fine-grained abstraction enables nuanced classification of system behaviors at multiple levels, demonstrating how abstraction levels multiply when combining taxonomic dimensions."

  - name: "Availability-driven vs Requirements-driven Dependencies"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 2:697-701)"
    quote: "In such systems, functionality largely relies on pre-configured rules and mechanisms. Thus, the functionality of such multi-agent system is contingent upon the predefined capabilities"
    description: "The paper distinguishes two abstraction patterns for architectural dependencies: availability-driven (bottom-up, low autonomy - dependent on what's available) vs requirements-driven (top-down, high autonomy - adapting to what's needed). This represents different levels of abstraction in how system components relate."

  - name: "Agent Type Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Taxonomy (Chunk 1:902-921)"
    quote: "Task-Management Agents... Domain Role Agents... Technical Agents"
    description: "The ontology model defines a three-tier agent type abstraction: (1) Task-Management Agents (meta-level orchestration), (2) Domain Role Agents (domain-specific expertise), (3) Technical Agents (platform/tool interfaces). This hierarchy represents abstraction levels from strategic coordination to technical execution."

  # Paper 19: Graph of Thoughts LLM Reasoning
  - name: "Graph-based Thought Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:17-21)"
    quote: "The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ('LLM thoughts') are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies"
    description: "GoT introduces a graph abstraction level for LLM reasoning that generalizes previous approaches (CoT, ToT). This abstraction represents thoughts as vertices and dependencies as edges, enabling arbitrary reasoning patterns at a higher abstraction level than linear chains or tree structures."

  - name: "Thought Transformation Abstraction Types"
    chunk_ref: "19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:344-364)"
    quote: "Aggregation Transformations... Refining Transformations... Generation Transformations"
    description: "GoT defines three abstraction levels for thought transformations: (1) Aggregation (combining multiple thoughts), (2) Refining (iterating on single thoughts), (3) Generation (creating new thoughts from existing ones). These represent different levels of reasoning abstraction applicable to the graph structure."

  - name: "Latency-Volume Tradeoff Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:732-743)"
    quote: "For a given thought t, the volume of t is the number of preceding LLM thoughts that could have impacted t... We assume that outputting a single thought costs O(1) time"
    description: "The paper introduces 'volume' as a new abstraction metric measuring how many thoughts contribute to a final outcome. This metric provides a way to abstract and compare the reasoning depth across different prompting paradigms (CoT, ToT, GoT), enabling theoretical analysis at a higher level than implementation details."

  - name: "Graph of Operations (GoO) Abstraction Layer"
    chunk_ref: "19-Graph_of_Thoughts (Chunk 1:390-396)"
    quote: "GoO is a static structure that specifies the graph decomposition of a given task, i.e., it prescribes transformations to be applied to LLM thoughts, together with their order & dependencies"
    description: "The Graph of Operations (GoO) serves as an abstraction layer between task decomposition strategy and runtime execution. It provides a static, declarative abstraction for specifying how thoughts should be transformed, separate from the dynamic Graph Reasoning State (GRS) that tracks actual execution."
