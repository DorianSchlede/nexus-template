patterns:
  - name: "Process Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:60-62)"
    quote: "a process is a particular procedure for doing something involving one or more steps or operations. The process may produce a product, a property of a product, or an aspect of a product"
    description: "Formal definition of Process as a procedure involving steps/operations that produces outputs. This is from ISO 1998 standard. In BBO, Process is a subclass of FlowElementsContainer and represents the key concept around which business process representation is organized."

  - name: "Activity Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:229)"
    quote: "Activity is the work to be performed. Activity class has three sub-classes: Task (an atomic task), Sub-Process (complex task that contains several Tasks), CallActivity"
    description: "Activity is defined as work to be performed, with three specializations: Task (atomic), Sub-Process (composite), and CallActivity (invokes reusable elements). Activity is related to LoopCharacteristics to represent iteration specifications."

  - name: "Task Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:230-231)"
    quote: "Task: an atomic task"
    description: "Task is defined as an atomic unit of work within the Activity hierarchy. A Task is limited to have at most one ManufacturingFacility because it is an atomic unit that should be performed at one place."

  - name: "Sub-Process Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:231)"
    quote: "Sub-Process: complex task that contains several Tasks"
    description: "Sub-Process is a composite activity that contains multiple Tasks. Unlike atomic Tasks, Sub-Processes may require several manufacturing facilities since they encompass multiple work units."

  - name: "Event Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:236-239)"
    quote: "Event is something that happens during the course of a process. Events affect the flow of the process and usually have a cause or an impact and may require or allow for a reaction"
    description: "Event is defined as an occurrence during process execution that affects process flow. Events have causes/impacts and may be interrupting or non-interrupting. Several event types exist: TimerEvent, ConditionalEvent, etc."

  - name: "Gateway Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:241)"
    quote: "Gateway is used to control how SequenceFlows interact as they converge or diverge within a Process"

  - name: "ConvergingGateway Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:248-249)"
    quote: "A Gateway with a gatewayDirection of converging MUST have multiple incoming Sequence Flows, but MUST NOT have multiple outgoing Sequence Flows"
    description: "ConvergingGateway is formally defined via cardinality restrictions: it must have 2+ incoming SequenceFlows and exactly 1 outgoing SequenceFlow. This definition is formalized in OWL as equivalence class with min/exactly restrictions."

  - name: "Agent Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:191-192)"
    quote: "Agent: the actor that performs a given process activity. Indeed, it is important to specify who is responsible for the accomplishment of a given activity"

  - name: "Role Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:350-353)"
    quote: "we differentiated Job from Role to offer more flexibility. Indeed, two persons that have the same Job, may have different authorization levels to execute Activities"

    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:282-286)"
