  # Paper 07: Classifying Processes (Barry Smith) - BFO Framework
  # ============================================================

  - name: "BFO Continuant Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:293-294)"
    quote: "BFO takes as its starting point a familiar distinction between two sets of views, which we can refer to as four-dimensionalist and three-dimensionalist"
    description: "Continuants are entities that are wholly present at any time they exist. They can be sliced along spatial dimensions but not temporal ones. Examples include things (pencils, people), qualities, and dispositions. In BFO, continuants may change from one time to the next by gaining and losing qualities."

  - name: "BFO Occurrent Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:299-300)"
    quote: "Four-dimensionalists see reality as consisting exclusively of four-dimensional entities (variously referred to as processes, events, occurrents, perdurants, spacetime-worms)"
    description: "Occurrents are entities that unfold in time and have temporal parts. They include processes, process boundaries (beginnings and endings), spatiotemporal regions, temporal intervals and instants. Occurrents cannot change - they ARE changes in the independent continuant entities which are their participants."

  - name: "BFO Independent Continuant"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:447-449)"
    quote: "In allowing not only things but also entities that are dependent on things as continuants, BFO draws on Aristotle's ideas concerning the division of substances and accidents"
    description: "Independent continuants are substances like molecules, organisms, planets - entities that can exist on their own. They serve as bearers for dependent continuants (qualities, dispositions). The BFO ontological square distinguishes independent continuants at both type and instance levels."

  - name: "BFO Dependent Continuant"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:405-409)"
    quote: "BFO generalizes Zemach's idea of a continuant entity by allowing not only things (such as pencils and people) as continuants, but also entities that are dependent on things, such as qualities and dispositions"
    description: "Dependent continuants include qualities and dispositions (like solubility, fragility). They depend on independent continuants as their bearers. A quality does not require a process of realization, while a disposition (like solubility) requires a process to be manifested."

  - name: "BFO Quality Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:458-459)"
    quote: "Qualities are first-class entities in the BFO ontology (of the sort referred to elsewhere in the literature as 'tropes', or 'individual accidents')"
    description: "Qualities are dependent entities that inhere in independent continuants. They instantiate quality universals divided into determinable (temperature, length, mass) and determinate (37.0C temperature, 1.6 meter length). Quality universals can be rigid (always exemplified while bearer exists)."

  - name: "BFO Process Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:547-552)"
    quote: "Our primary concern in the remainder of this essay is with BFO's treatment of occurrents, which include processes, process boundaries, spatiotemporal regions, and temporal intervals and instants"
    description: "Processes are temporally extended occurrents that occupy spatiotemporal regions and span temporal intervals. They stand to independent continuants (their participants) in a relation of specific dependence, analogous to how qualities relate to their bearers."

  - name: "BFO Process Boundary"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:548-552)"
    quote: "BFO's treatment of occurrents, which include processes, process boundaries (for example beginnings and endings), spatiotemporal regions, and temporal intervals"
    description: "Process boundaries are instantaneous occurrents that mark beginnings and endings of processes. They span temporal instants rather than intervals, distinguishing them from temporally extended processes."

  - name: "BFO Type/Universal Entity"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:100-102)"
    quote: "We can think of the nodes in such a graph as representing types or universals, which are the sorts of entities represented by the general terms used in formulating scientific theories such as 'cell' or 'electron'"
    description: "Types/universals are general entities that have instances. The is_a relation between types represents subtype relationships (all instances of first type are instances of second). Ontologies comprise theoretical terms representing types together with relational expressions."

  - name: "BFO Instance/Particular Entity"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:101-103)"
    quote: "types or universals which have instances which are the sorts of entities that are observed in scientific experiments"
    description: "Instances/particulars are the entities observed in experiments - specific occurrences of types. The BFO ontological square captures both the type-instance and independent-dependent distinctions creating four categories."

  - name: "BFO Object Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:285-287)"
    quote: "BFO is very small, consisting of just 34 terms, including both familiar terms such as 'process', 'object', 'function', 'role' and 'disposition'"
    description: "Object is a core BFO term representing independent continuants that can serve as participants in processes. Objects are three-dimensional things like you and me - entities with spatial parts but no temporal parts."

  - name: "BFO Function Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:285-286)"
    quote: "BFO is very small, consisting of just 34 terms, including both familiar terms such as 'process', 'object', 'function', 'role' and 'disposition'"
    description: "Function is a core BFO term for a type of realizable entity (disposition) that is realized through processes. Functions are dependent continuants that require specific kinds of processes for their realization."

  - name: "BFO Role Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:285-286)"
    quote: "BFO is very small, consisting of just 34 terms, including both familiar terms such as 'process', 'object', 'function', 'role' and 'disposition'"
    description: "Role is a core BFO term representing a type of realizable dependent continuant. Roles define the part an entity plays in relation to other entities and can be gained or lost over time unlike essential qualities."

  - name: "BFO Disposition Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:286)"
    quote: "familiar terms such as 'process', 'object', 'function', 'role' and 'disposition', and less familiar terms such as 'generically dependent continuant'"
    description: "Disposition is a BFO term for realizable dependent continuants like solubility and fragility. Dispositions require a process of realization to be manifested - the solubility of salt requires a dissolving process."

  - name: "BFO Generically Dependent Continuant"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:625-632)"
    quote: "the BFO:generically dependent continuant expression: '1.7 m tall'. It is an information artifact. It can be stored, for instance, as a record"
    description: "Generically dependent continuants are entities like information artifacts that can be transferred through exact copying. They contrast with specifically dependent entities (like temperature) that cannot migrate from one bearer to another."

  - name: "BFO Spatiotemporal Region"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:652-654)"
    quote: "the BFO:spatiotemporal region occupied by this process (the path of the motion), the BFO:temporal region spanned by this process (the temporal projection)"
    description: "Spatiotemporal regions are occurrent entities that processes occupy. They define the path of motion and provide the dimensional framework for process measurement and attribution."

  - name: "BFO Process Profile Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:119-126)"
    quote: "When comparing two heart beating processes as being for example of the same rate, there is something in each of the two processes which is - not numerically but qualitatively - 'the same'. This something we shall refer to as a process profile"
    description: "Process profiles are occurrent entities that represent what processes share when they can be compared along certain dimensions (rate, speed, etc.). They are the targets of selective abstraction focused on specific structural dimensions of processes."

  - name: "BFO Quality Process Profile"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:152-157)"
    quote: "The simplest example of a process profile is that part of a process which serves as the target of selective abstraction focused on a sequence of instances of determinate qualities such as temperature or height"
    description: "Quality process profiles capture sequences of quality instances plotted over time, like a temperature chart. They represent the simplest form of process profile where quality values are measured against time."

  - name: "BFO Rate Process Profile"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:174-179)"
    quote: "On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused on certain ratios between these magnitudes and associated intervals of elapsed time"
    description: "Rate process profiles capture ratios like speed (distance/time). They include subtypes like constant speed profiles, acceleration profiles, with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels of generality."

  - name: "BFO Cyclical Process Profile"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:238-243)"
    quote: "One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by cyclical processes, for example the 60 beats per minute beating process of John's heart"
    description: "Cyclical process profiles are a subtype of rate process profiles where the salient ratio is number of cycles per unit time. Includes regular and irregular cyclical profiles, important for clinical and diagnostic applications."

  # ============================================================

  - name: "OCEL Event Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:149-154)"
    quote: "Events: Object-centric process mining works on discrete events. They represent the various actions or activities that occur within a system or process, such as approving an order"
    description: "Events are atomic, discrete occurrences with a timestamp that represent actions or activities in a process. Every event is unique, corresponds to a specific action at a specific point in time, may have attributes, and is typed. Events are the fundamental unit of observation in OCEL."

  - name: "OCEL Event Type Entity"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:157-161)"
    quote: "Event Types: Events are categorized into different types based on their nature or function. For example, a procurement process might have event types such as Order Created, Order Approved"
    description: "Event types (also called activities) categorize events by their nature or function. Each event belongs to exactly one type. Event types define the kinds of actions possible in a process and group events that represent the same kind of activity."

  - name: "OCEL Object Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:164-167)"
    quote: "Objects: In object-centric process mining, objects represent the entities that are involved in events. These might be physical items like products in a supply chain, or abstract entities like orders, invoices"
    description: "Objects are entities involved in events - physical items (products, machines, workers) or abstract entities (orders, invoices, contracts). Objects have attributes with values that may change over time, capturing the dynamic nature of business entities."

  - name: "OCEL Object Type Entity"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:170-171)"
    quote: "Object Types: Each object is of one type. The object is an instantiation of its type. Object types might include categories like Product, Order, Invoice, or Supplier"
    description: "Object types categorize objects into classes like Product, Order, Invoice, Supplier. Each object belongs to exactly one type. Object types define the schema of attributes applicable to objects of that type."

  - name: "OCEL Event-to-Object Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:178-185)"
    quote: "Event-to-Object (E2O) Relationships: Events are associated with objects. This relationship describes that an object affects an event or that an event affects an object"
    description: "E2O relationships link events to objects with optional qualifiers describing the role an object plays in an event. Unlike traditional logs where events relate to one case, OCEL events can relate to multiple objects. Qualifiers distinguish roles (e.g., meeting organizer vs participant)."

  - name: "OCEL Object-to-Object Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:191-194)"
    quote: "Object-to-Object (O2O) Relationships: Objects can also be related to other objects outside the context of an event. For example, an employee may be part of an organizational unit"
    description: "O2O relationships link objects to each other independent of events, with qualifiers describing the relationship nature (part-of, reports-to, belongs-to). This captures organizational and structural relationships between business entities."

  - name: "OCEL Attribute Entity"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:362-365)"
    quote: "Uattr is the universe of attribute names. Uval is the universe of attribute values"
    description: "Attributes are named properties that can be assigned to events and objects. Event attributes are static per event while object attributes can be dynamic, changing over time. Attributes provide the data perspective alongside the control flow."

  - name: "OCEL Timestamp Entity"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:368-369)"
    quote: "Utime is the universe of timestamps (with 0 as the smallest element and infinity as the largest element)"
    description: "Timestamps are totally ordered temporal values that record when events occur and when object attributes change. The temporal dimension enables reconstructing process execution order and analyzing performance."

  - name: "OCEL Qualifier Entity"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:372)"
    quote: "Uqual is the universe of qualifiers"
    description: "Qualifiers are strings that describe the nature of relationships between events/objects. They enable rich semantic annotation of how entities relate (e.g., 'Invoice created starting from the PO', 'Payment block due to unethical buying')."

  - name: "OCEL Dynamic Object Attribute"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:293-297)"
    quote: "Dynamic Object Attribute Values: OCEL 2.0 adopts a dynamic approach where attribute values can change over time. Instead of having a single, fixed value, an object attribute may have a value that changes"
    description: "Dynamic object attributes capture how object properties evolve during process execution. Values are tracked with timestamps allowing reconstruction of attribute state at any point in time. This reflects realistic business scenarios."

    quote: "Mainstream process mining techniques start from an event log, i.e., a collection of events extracted from the databases supporting the process execution"
    description: "Events in OC-PM are records extracted from databases that capture process execution. Each event has an activity, timestamp, and can be related to multiple objects of different types, enabling richer process representation than traditional single-case logs."

  - name: "OC-PM Case Entity (Traditional)"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:48-52)"
    quote: "In such event logs, a case is a collection of events related to a particular process execution. For example, in a sales order management system, a case may refer to all events related to the creation and confirmation of the order"
    description: "In traditional process mining, a case groups events belonging to one process execution. However, defining cases introduces convergence (same event in multiple cases) and divergence (multiple instances of same activity) problems that object-centric mining addresses."

    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:601-611)"
    quote: "The lifecycle of an object o is the sequence of events to which the object is related. The trace of an object is the sequence of activities of the events belonging to its lifecycle"
    description: "Lifecycle captures the sequence of events related to an object throughout its existence. Start and end activities identify process boundaries. Lifecycles enable object-centric analysis without artificial case flattening."

    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:769-774)"
    quote: "N = A union {nS,ot | ot in OT} union {nE,ot | ot in OT} is the set of nodes of the graph, which includes the set of activities and a start/end node for each object type"
    description: "OC-DFG nodes include activities plus start/end nodes for each object type. This structure captures how different object types have different entry and exit points in the process, enabling multi-perspective process views."
