  # Paper 20: Agentic RAG Survey - Entity Count Patterns

  - name: "RAG Core Components Triad"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:158-170)"
    quote: "The architecture of RAG systems integrates three primary components... Retrieval... Augmentation... Generation"
    description: "RAG systems are built on exactly 3 core components: Retrieval (querying external data), Augmentation (processing retrieved data), and Generation (combining retrieved info with LLM knowledge). This minimal entity count enables clean separation of concerns in retrieval-augmented systems."

  - name: "AI Agent Four Components"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:484-502)"
    quote: "In essence, an AI agent comprises... LLM (with defined Role and Task)... Memory (Short-Term and Long-Term)... Planning (Reflection & Self-Critique)... Tools"
    description: "AI agents are defined with exactly 4 core components: LLM (reasoning engine), Memory (short/long-term context), Planning (iterative reasoning), and Tools (external capabilities). This 4-entity model provides a minimal but complete agent architecture."

  - name: "Four Agentic Design Patterns"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:507-509)"
    quote: "Four key patterns underpin agentic workflows"
    description: "The paper identifies exactly 4 agentic design patterns: Reflection, Planning, Tool Use, and Multi-Agent Collaboration. These 4 patterns form the complete behavioral vocabulary for agentic systems, suggesting a minimal set for describing agent behavior."

  - name: "Five RAG Paradigm Evolution"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:183-184)"
    quote: "Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and Agentic RAG alongside their defining characteristics"
    description: "The evolution of RAG is characterized through 5 distinct paradigms, each representing an increase in capability and complexity. This taxonomy provides a progression model for understanding RAG system sophistication."

  - name: "Five Agentic Workflow Patterns"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:610-725)"
    quote: "Prompt chaining... Routing... Parallelization... Orchestrator-Workers... Evaluator-Optimizer"
    description: "The paper identifies 5 agentic workflow patterns for structuring LLM-based applications: Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, and Evaluator-Optimizer. These 5 patterns represent the complete set of structural approaches for organizing agent workflows."

  - name: "Single vs Multi-Agent Architecture Dichotomy"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:746-750)"
    quote: "single-agent architectures, multi-agent systems, and hierarchical agentic architectures"
    description: "Agentic RAG systems are categorized into 3 architectural types: single-agent, multi-agent, and hierarchical. This 3-type taxonomy covers the spectrum from simple to complex agent organization."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Four Specialized Roles"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:890-904)"
    quote: "Agent 1: Handles structured queries... Agent 2: Manages semantic searches... Agent 3: Focuses on retrieving real-time public information... Agent 4: Specializes in recommendation systems"
    description: "Multi-agent RAG systems exemplify 4 specialized agent roles based on data source type: structured data agent, semantic search agent, real-time information agent, and recommendation agent. This shows how entity count scales with functional specialization."

  # Paper 22: RPA Framework - Entity Count Patterns

  - name: "Five Evaluation Perspectives Framework"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:20-21)"
    quote: "We design a framework that consists of thirteen criteria grouped into five perspectives which offer different evaluation aspects"
    description: "The RPA viability framework uses exactly 5 perspectives (Task, Time, Data, System, Human) containing 13 criteria total. This demonstrates a middle-ground entity count balancing comprehensiveness with usability for process evaluation."

  - name: "Thirteen Evaluation Criteria"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:235-236)"
    quote: "We present five perspectives - task, time, data, system, and human - that contain several characteristics"
    description: "The complete RPA evaluation framework contains exactly 13 criteria across 5 perspectives: Task (Standardization, Maturity, Determinism, Failure Rate), Time (Frequency, Duration, Urgency), Data (Structuredness), System (Interfaces, Stability, Number of Systems), Human (Resources, Proneness to Human Error). This demonstrates a domain-specific entity count optimized for RPA assessment."

  - name: "Task Perspective Four Criteria"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:325-326)"
    quote: "The task perspective refers to the execution of process activities. Its criteria are standardization, maturity, determinism, and failure rate"
    description: "The Task perspective alone contains 4 evaluation criteria: standardization, maturity, determinism, and failure rate. This sub-grouping shows hierarchical entity organization within the larger 13-criteria framework."

  # Paper 23: UFO Story - Entity Count Patterns

  - name: "UFO Three-Strata Organization"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:170-193)"
    quote: "The ontology is divided in three strata dealing with different aspects of reality, namely: UFO-A... UFO-B... UFO-C"
    description: "UFO is organized into exactly 3 strata: UFO-A (Endurants/structural modeling), UFO-B (Perdurants/events/processes), UFO-C (Intentional and Social Entities). This 3-layer organization provides systematic coverage of reality while maintaining clear separation of concerns."

  - name: "Four-Category Ontology Foundation"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:126-129)"
    quote: "we needed a Four-Category Ontology... individuals and universals and one that would include not only substantial individuals and universals but also accidents"
    description: "UFO is grounded in a Four-Category Ontology structure: Substantial Individuals, Substantial Universals, Accident Individuals (particularized properties), and Accident Universals. This 4-entity meta-structure is derived from Aristotelian philosophy and provides the foundational categorization for all other entities."

  - name: "UFO-A Comprehensive Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:173-181)"
    quote: "UFO-A: An Ontology of Endurants... Four-Category ontology comprising theories of Types and Taxonomic Structures... Part-Whole Relations, Particularized Intrinsic Properties, Attributes and Attribute Value Spaces... Particularized Relational Properties and Relations and Roles"
    description: "UFO-A alone encompasses multiple entity categories: Types/Taxonomic Structures, Part-Whole Relations, Particularized Intrinsic Properties, Attributes, Attribute Value Spaces, Datatypes, Particularized Relational Properties, Relations, and Roles. This demonstrates that foundational ontologies (like UFO's ~50 entities) require substantial entity counts for philosophical completeness."

  - name: "OntoUML Universal Type Distinctions"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:366-368)"
    quote: "substance sortals (kinds), phased-sortals (roles and phases) and non-sortals (categories, mixins and role mixins)"
    description: "OntoUML/UFO distinguishes 6 types of universals: Kinds (substance sortals), Roles (phased-sortals), Phases (phased-sortals), Categories (non-sortals), Mixins (non-sortals), and Role Mixins (non-sortals). This 6-type classification provides the entity-type vocabulary for ontology-driven conceptual modeling."
