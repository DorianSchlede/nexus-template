patterns:
  - name: "Ontological Knowledge Graph for LLM Context"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:31-33)"
    quote: "the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts"
    description: "The SciAgents framework uses ontological knowledge graphs as the foundational substrate for LLM reasoning. The knowledge graph provides structured context that enables LLMs to understand relationships between concepts, guiding the generation of novel hypotheses. This pattern shows how ontologies can organize domain knowledge to enhance AI reasoning capabilities."

  - name: "Multi-Agent System with In-Situ Learning"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:33-34)"
    quote: "multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities"
    description: "The framework combines multiple LLM-based agents that can learn and adapt during the discovery process. Each agent has specialized roles and capabilities, enabling collaborative problem-solving that surpasses single-agent approaches. This demonstrates how AI agents can be orchestrated to tackle complex scientific discovery tasks."

  - name: "In-Context Learning from Graph Representations"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:95-102)"
    quote: "In-context learning emerges as a compelling strategy to enhance the performance of LLMs without the need for costly and time-intensive fine-tuning"
    description: "Rather than fine-tuning models, SciAgents uses in-context learning where the knowledge graph provides context within prompts. This enables LLMs to adapt responses based on structured domain knowledge without retraining, making the approach more flexible and cost-effective for scientific discovery."

  - name: "Sub-graph Sampling for Context Injection"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:133-148)"
    quote: "a novel sampling strategy to extract relevant sub-graphs from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand the key concepts and their interrelationships"
    description: "The system uses strategic sub-graph sampling from the larger ontological knowledge graph to provide focused, relevant context to LLM agents. This contextually informed backdrop guides hypothesis generation while ensuring hypotheses are rooted in a comprehensive knowledge framework."

  - name: "Role-Based Agent Specialization"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:225-230)"
    quote: "Each agent plays a specialized role: The Ontologist defines key concepts and relationships, Scientist 1 crafts a detailed research proposal, Scientist 2 expands and refines the proposal, and the Critic agent conducts a thorough review"
    description: "The multi-agent system assigns distinct roles to each LLM agent through complex prompting strategies. Agents include Ontologist (defines concepts), Scientists (craft and refine proposals), Critic (reviews), and Planner (develops plans). This division of labor enables systematic exploration of complex problems."

  - name: "Random Path Exploration for Novel Discovery"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:243-247)"
    quote: "Unlike in earlier work where the shortest path was utilized, our study employs a random path approach...the random approach infuses the path with a richer array of concepts"
    description: "Instead of using shortest paths in knowledge graphs, SciAgents employs random path sampling to explore broader conceptual spaces. This approach enhances novelty in hypothesis generation by exposing agents to more diverse relationships and domains than deterministic shortest-path methods."

  - name: "Ontologist Agent for Knowledge Interpretation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:289-296)"
    quote: "the ontologist agent helps transition from static knowledge retrieval to dynamic knowledge generation...applies advanced reasoning and inference techniques to synthesize and interpret the complex web of data"
    description: "A dedicated Ontologist LLM agent interprets the knowledge graph relationships, extracting insights that might not be obvious at first glance. This agent bridges the gap between structured ontological data and natural language understanding, enabling deeper analysis of concept relationships."

  - name: "Structured JSON Output for Hypothesis Components"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:361-365)"
    quote: "The agent creates a proposal that carefully addresses the following seven key aspects: hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty"
    description: "LLM agents generate structured JSON outputs containing specific research proposal components. This schema-constrained generation ensures comprehensive coverage of hypothesis elements and enables systematic evaluation of scientific ideas through well-defined criteria."

  - name: "Hierarchical Expansion Strategy"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:200-210)"
    quote: "We employ a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling"
    description: "The system uses iterative refinement where initial outputs are successively expanded, enriched with external data, critiqued, and amended. This hierarchical approach mimics scientific peer review processes, with each iteration adding depth and rigor to generated hypotheses."

  - name: "Critic Agent for Adversarial Review"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:511-516)"
    quote: "the Critic agent, responsible for thoroughly reviewing the research proposal, summarizing its key points, and recommending improvements...delivers a comprehensive scientific critique, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses"
    description: "A dedicated Critic LLM agent performs adversarial review of generated hypotheses, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for refinement. This creates an internal feedback loop that improves hypothesis quality without external human intervention."

  - name: "Tool Integration for Literature Novelty Assessment"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:795-799)"
    quote: "we have empowered our automated multi-agent model with the Semantic Scholar API as a tool that provides it with an ability to check the novelty of the generated hypothesis against the existing literature"
    description: "The multi-agent system integrates external tools (Semantic Scholar API) to validate hypothesis novelty against existing literature. This function-calling pattern enables agents to ground their outputs in real-world research, eliminating ideas too similar to existing work."

  - name: "Autonomous Agent Self-Organization"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:151-154)"
    quote: "the autonomous multi-agent system can develop sophisticated problem solving strategies on its own"
    description: "The automated multi-agent system can self-organize without predetermined interaction sequences, dynamically responding to evolving research contexts. A Group Chat Manager selects working agents based on current context, enabling flexible collaboration patterns that emerge from the problem space."

  - name: "Shared Memory for Agent Collaboration"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:784-788)"
    quote: "the second approach allows agents to share memory, giving them access to all the content generated in previous interactions. This means they operate with full visibility of the history of their collaboration"
    description: "In the automated approach, agents share a common memory containing all previously generated content. This full visibility of collaboration history enables more coherent and contextually aware responses compared to filtered information passing."

  - name: "Human-in-the-Loop Integration"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:191-194)"
