    quote: "Then we can treat any derived entity (n1, n2) just like any other entity and infer the df-relationships for (n1, n2)"
    description: "Describes how relationships between entities can be reified into derived entities, creating new entity types that capture interactions. This enables inferring directly-follows relationships that describe cross-entity behavior, turning structural relations into behavioral ones."

    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:54-58)"
    quote: "construct entities and correlation based on the presence of an entity identifier or a relation; and derive a local directly-follows relation from the viewpoint of each entity"
    description: "The df-relationship connects events from the perspective of each entity. Events are correlated to entities, and temporal ordering is inferred per entity rather than globally, enabling multi-perspective behavioral analysis."

  - name: "Entity-Event Correlation Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:265-271)"
    quote: "We select a subset of entities, but keep all event nodes correlated to the entities and all directly-follows relations between the events of these entities"
    description: "Entities are correlated to events through explicit 'corr' relationships. This entity-event correlation is fundamental to event knowledge graphs, enabling filtering and selection operations based on entity types."

  - name: "Event Synchronization Between Entities"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:155-161)"
    quote: "Two or more entities n1,...,nk synchronize in a shared event e if two or more df-paths of n1,...,nk go through e"

  - name: "Entity Creation Relationship via Starting Event"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:169-173)"
    quote: "An event e that is intermediate for one entity n but a starting event for entities n1,...,nk can be interpreted as entity n 'created' or 'initiated' entities n1,...,nk"
    description: "Entity creation relationships are inferred when one entity's intermediate event is another entity's starting event. This captures lifecycle relationships like 'Supplier Order A created Items X1, X2, X3'."

    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:196-199)"

  - name: "Asynchronous Message-Passing Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:199-202)"

    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:598-604)"
    quote: "We prefer the term Actor used in organizations research, as each actor follows its own behavior. To study actor behavior... we only have to (1) infer the Actor entities from the event nodes, and (2) infer each actor's df-path"
    description: "Actors (resources/workers) are modeled as entities whose df-paths describe their work patterns. This enables analysis of how actors perform tasks across multiple other entities."

  - name: "Synchronization Edge in Proclet Models"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:888-890)"
    quote: "Dashed synchronization edges between transitions describe that the transitions have to occur together; the multiplicity annotations indicate how many entities of each type have to be involved"
    description: "Synchronization edges in proclet models explicitly capture cardinality constraints between entity types during synchronized activities. Example: R4 packs 2-3 Items into 1 Shipment."

    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:17-23)"
    quote: "Object-centric Petri nets also first discover one Petri net per entity type, then annotate the places and arcs with entity identifiers, and then compose all entity nets along transitions for the same activity"
    description: "Entity relationships in object-centric Petri nets are captured through composition along shared activities. Entity nets are composed at transitions where multiple entity types participate together."

  - name: "Entity Interaction Relationship via Proclets"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:22-23)"
    quote: "synchronization by composition prevents explicitly modeling (and thus discovering) interactions between entities such as the relation from Order to Payment described by proclet (Order,Payment)"
    description: "Some entity relationships (like Order-Payment interactions) require explicit modeling beyond simple composition. Derived entity types like (Order,Payment) capture complex inter-entity behavior patterns."

    quote: "Many source systems, including popular ERP systems, store data at the logical level of objects instead of providing a true process perspective... object or artifact centricity"
    description: "In object-centric approaches, events relate to multiple objects rather than single cases. The OCEL standard enables representing events with connections to multiple case notions."

  - name: "Event Abstraction Aggregation Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:476-481)"
    quote: "abstraction techniques can be considered as mapping techniques that can translate one or more lower-level events into higher-level events pertaining to business process activities"
