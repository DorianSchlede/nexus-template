    quote: "Knowledge graph (KG), representing facts in the form of triples, with vocabulary defined in a schema (also known as ontology), is a simple yet efficient and increasingly popular way of knowledge representation"
    description: "Entity relationships in KGs are represented as triples (subject-predicate-object), with schema/ontology defining the vocabulary. This establishes the fundamental structural relationship pattern for knowledge representation."

  - name: "Rule-Based Inference Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning_Logics_Embeddings_Survey (Chunk 1:79-85)"
    quote: "One rule, which can be simply represented as H <- B1 AND B2 AND ... Bn, means that the head atom H can be inferred by the body atoms B1, ..., Bn. For example, isfatherOf(X, Y) <- Male(X) AND isParentOf(X, Y)"
    description: "Logical rules define inferential relationships between entities through conditional statements. The example shows how entity relationships (isfatherOf) can be derived from other relationships (Male, isParentOf) through logical conjunction."

  - name: "Class Hierarchy Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning_Logics_Embeddings_Survey (Chunk 1:200-202)"
    quote: "Class hierarchies classify entity types, denoting entities as instantiations of classes. There are two tasks for injecting class hierarchies, encoding the types of entities and encoding hierarchies of entity types"
    description: "Entities participate in is-a/instantiation relationships with classes, and classes form hierarchical subsumption relationships with each other. This defines both type membership and taxonomic structure."

  - name: "Relation Hierarchy Subsumption"

    description: "Relations have mathematical properties (symmetric, asymmetric, transitive, reflexive, compositional) that constrain how entity relationships behave. These properties enable inference of additional relationships from existing ones."

  - name: "Equivalent and Inverse Relation Properties"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning_Logics_Embeddings_Survey (Chunk 1:251-254)"
    quote: "we introduce relation properties constraining multiple relations that have been considered, including Equivalent and Inverse. Given these two pre-defined relation properties..."
    description: "Equivalent relations establish that two different relation names refer to the same relationship. Inverse relations establish that if R(a,b) holds, then R-inverse(b,a) also holds. These are inter-relation relationships."

    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning_Logics_Embeddings_Survey (Chunk 1:359-365)"
    quote: "Query answering returns correct entities in a KG as answers of a given structured query, where reasoning is usually considered for hidden answers... For example, path queries proposed in [Guu et al., 2015]"
    description: "Structured queries express complex relationship patterns involving path traversal, conjunction, disjunction, and negation over entity relationships. Entities are connected through multi-hop relationship paths."

  - name: "Conjunctive and Disjunctive Query Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "17-KG_Reasoning_Logics_Embeddings_Survey (Chunk 1:394-406)"
    quote: "Apart from simple path queries, more complex queries, such as conjunctive logical queries and Existential Positive First-Order (EPFO), involving multiple unobserved edges, nodes, and even variables are also widely researched"
    description: "Complex queries combine entity relationships through logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to express sophisticated relationship patterns across multiple entities and relationship types."
