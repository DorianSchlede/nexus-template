patterns:
  - name: "Multi-Entity Event Data Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:16-21)"
    quote: "We introduce event knowledge graphs as data structure that allows to naturally model behavior over multiple entities as a network of events"
    description: "The paper introduces event knowledge graphs as a higher abstraction level than classical event logs. This represents a domain-level abstraction that enables process mining analyses across multiple behavioral dimensions simultaneously, moving beyond single-entity case identifier approaches to graph-based multi-entity representations."

  - name: "Entity Type Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:83-85)"
    quote: "This process relies on 7 different types of entities. Actors (human workers) and machines (an automated warehouse) together handle 5 types of objects"
    description: "The paper establishes a hierarchical abstraction of entity types - distinguishing between actor entities (workers, machines) and object entities (Orders, Supplier Orders, Items, Invoices, Payments). This creates a domain-level ontological structure for categorizing process participants."

  - name: "Classical vs Graph-Based Abstraction Levels"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:158-164)"
    quote: "instead of constructing entire traces related to a single case identifier, we discuss a local directly-follows relation for each individual entity in the data"
    description: "The paper contrasts two abstraction levels: classical event log abstraction (single case identifier, sequential traces) versus a higher graph-based abstraction (local directly-follows relations per entity). The graph approach represents a more expressive domain-level abstraction enabling richer behavioral analysis."

  - name: "Labeled Property Graph Foundation"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:550-552)"
    quote: "A typed graph data model such as labeled property graphs allows to distinguish different types of nodes (events, entities) and relationships (directly-follows, correlated-to)"
    description: "The foundational data model abstraction using labeled property graphs provides the core-level abstraction for event knowledge graphs. This establishes formal semantics for distinguishing node types (Event, Entity) and relationship types (df, corr) as the building blocks of the framework."

  - name: "Event Knowledge Graph Formal Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:624-627)"
    quote: "An event knowledge graph is an LPG G = (N, R, lambda, #) with node labels {Event, Entity} and relationship labels {df, corr}"
    description: "This is the core-level formal ontological definition establishing the abstraction level of event knowledge graphs. It specifies exactly two node types (Event, Entity) and two relationship types (directly-follows, correlation) as the fundamental abstractions for representing process behavior."

  - name: "Derived Entity Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:3-5)"
    quote: "we can treat any derived entity (n1, n2) just like any other entity and infer the df-relationships for (n1, n2), which results in a new path describing the interactions"
    description: "The paper introduces derived entities as a higher abstraction level - reifying relations between entity types into new composite entity types. This domain-level abstraction pattern enables analysis of inter-entity interactions not visible in the original entity structure."

  - name: "Class-Level Event Aggregation"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:321-324)"
    quote: "aggregating sets of events into activities (or event classes), and aggregating df-relationships between events into corresponding relationships between activities"
    description: "The paper describes activity-level abstraction through aggregation - moving from individual event nodes to Class nodes representing activity types. This is a domain-level abstraction that enables process model discovery by abstracting temporal event instances into structural activity patterns."

  - name: "Multi-Entity Directly-Follows Graph Discovery"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:362-367)"
    quote: "The resulting graph is a multi-entity directly-follows graph, also called multi-viewpoint DFG or artifact-centric model"
    description: "Multi-entity DFG represents an application-level abstraction for process discovery - aggregating event-level behavior into process models that respect per-entity behavioral semantics. This abstraction level bridges raw event data with interpretable process models."

  - name: "Task Instance Abstraction Layer"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:621-627)"
    quote: "A task instance of an actor R working on an entity X materializes in an event knowledge graph as a specific subgraph over event nodes e1,...,ek"
    description: "Task instances represent a domain-level abstraction that aggregates multiple related activities performed by an actor on an entity into a coherent 'unit of work'. This abstraction reveals higher-level work patterns not visible at the individual event level."

  - name: "Multi-Layer Process Knowledge Graph"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:698-699)"
    quote: "An event knowledge graph extended with additional layers into a 'process knowledge graph'"
    description: "The paper proposes multi-layered abstraction combining Event Entity Layer, Task Instance Layer, Task Layer, and Class Layer. Each layer represents a different abstraction level - from raw events up to discovered process models, enabling hierarchical analysis perspectives."

  - name: "Three Essential Event Log Requirements"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:68-75)"
    quote: "each event should be linked to a case or process instance, typically by using a Case ID. This is 'Requirement 1'"
    description: "The paper establishes foundational-level data requirements for event logs: Case ID, Activity Label, and Timestamp. These three attributes form the minimal abstraction layer enabling process mining analysis, representing the core data model for process event data."

  - name: "Event Abstraction Granularity Transformation"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:103-109)"
    quote: "oftentimes, natural log data is stored at lower levels of granularity than desired for analysis purposes. Typically, one would prefer that the granularity level of activities"
    description: "The paper addresses abstraction level mismatch - raw event data often at lower granularity than business-interpretable activity level. Event abstraction techniques transform fine-grained events into coarser activity-level representations suitable for process analysis."

  - name: "Extraction-Correlation-Abstraction Pipeline"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:383-384)"
    quote: "event log preparation often includes three types of techniques: extraction, correlation and abstraction"
    description: "The paper identifies a three-stage abstraction pipeline: extraction (obtaining raw events from sources), correlation (mapping events to cases), and abstraction (transforming event granularity). This represents an application-level methodology for preparing process mining data."

  - name: "Object-Centric vs Flat Event Log Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:424-433)"
    quote: "Many source systems, including popular ERP systems, store data at the logical level of objects instead of providing a true process perspective"
    description: "The paper contrasts object-centric data abstraction (as stored in source systems) with flattened event log abstraction (required for classical process mining). OCEL standard represents a domain-level abstraction bridging these two views."

  - name: "Ontological Knowledge Graph Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 1:31-33)"
    quote: "the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts"
    description: "SciAgents uses ontological knowledge graphs as a foundational abstraction layer organizing scientific concepts and relationships. This provides the structural substrate for multi-agent graph reasoning, representing domain knowledge in a machine-processable form."

  - name: "Hierarchical Multi-Agent Task Decomposition"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 1:125-130)"
    quote: "the discovery workflow is systematically broken down into more manageable subtasks. Each agent in the system is assigned a distinct role"
    description: "SciAgents employs hierarchical task abstraction - decomposing complex scientific discovery into subtasks (path generation, ontological analysis, hypothesis generation, critique). Each abstraction level corresponds to a specialized agent role in the multi-agent system."

  - name: "Path-Based Subgraph Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 1:241-246)"
    quote: "To augment the capabilities of our underlying large language model, we provide it with a sub-graph derived from this more extensive knowledge graph"
    description: "The paper uses path-based subgraph extraction as an abstraction mechanism - sampling random paths through the knowledge graph creates focused context for LLM reasoning. This domain-level abstraction filters the global graph into task-relevant local views."

  - name: "Structured JSON Hypothesis Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 1:362-364)"
    quote: "The agent creates a proposal that carefully addresses the following seven key aspects: hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty"
    description: "SciAgents defines a structured abstraction schema for research hypotheses with seven mandatory fields. This application-level abstraction provides a consistent format for AI-generated scientific proposals, enabling systematic comparison and critique across experiments."
