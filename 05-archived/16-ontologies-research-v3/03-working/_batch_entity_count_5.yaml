  - name: "BBO 106 Concepts Total Count"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:471-473)"
    quote: "Concepts|Relationships others than isA|isA relations|Metrics| |106|125|83|RD = 125/(125+83) = 0.60"
    description: |
      BBO ontology contains exactly 106 concepts (entity classes). This count is explicitly stated in the
      schema metrics evaluation table. The paper provides precise counts: 106 concepts, 125 non-inheritance
      relationships, and 83 isA (inheritance) relationships. This entity count is designed to cover
      business process representation in a detailed, fine-grained manner for Industry 4.0 applications.

  - name: "Five Main Concept Categories"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:183-196)"
    quote: "Based on the study of the previous knowledge sources, we have identified five main concepts that must be covered by BBO ontology: 1. Process... 2. Input/output specifications... 3. Agent... 4. Work product... 5. Manufacturing facility"
    description: |
      BBO's 106 concepts are organized around five main concept categories: (1) Process - the key concept
      covering decomposition into activities, sub-processes, and tasks; (2) Input/output specifications -
      resources and parameter values; (3) Agent - the actor performing process activities; (4) Work product -
      things produced by processes; (5) Manufacturing facility - where activities are performed. This
      five-category structure provides the rationale for the entity count - sufficient granularity to
      answer competency questions while remaining domain-focused.

  - name: "Entity Count Rationale via Schema Metrics"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:461-466)"
    quote: "SD = NH/NC. This measure describes the distribution of classes across different levels of the ontology class hierarchy. The SD value of BBO is low (less than one hypernymy link per class): it means that the ontology is deep (or vertical): it covers a knowledge domain (i.e., BPs) in a detailed manner."
    description: |
      The entity count of 106 is justified by the schema deepness (SD) metric. With SD = 0.78 (83/106),
      the ontology is characterized as "deep" or "vertical" - covering the business process domain in
      detail. The low SD indicates many specific leaf classes rather than broad hierarchical structures.
      This validates that the 106-entity count serves detailed domain coverage rather than being
      artificially inflated or sparse.

  - name: "BPMN 2.0 Core Extraction Contributing to Entity Count"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:216-223)"
    quote: "We manually studied the BPMN 2.0 specification document (OMG., 2011), more than 500 pages, to select the fragments dedicated to the representation of processes... FlowNode class groups the activities that compose a process"
    description: |
      A significant portion of BBO's 106 entities derives from BPMN 2.0 metamodel extraction. The authors
      deliberately selected fragments from the 500+ page BPMN specification focused on process representation,
      excluding graphical representation and collaboration elements. Core BPMN entities include: Process,
      FlowElementsContainer, FlowElements, SequenceFlow, FlowNode, Activity, Task, Sub-Process, CallActivity,
      Event, and Gateway classes. This selective extraction approach explains why BBO has 106 entities
      rather than matching the full BPMN metamodel size.

  - name: "Additional Entity Classes from Natural Language Specifications"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:255-265)"
    quote: "|Concept|Sub-concepts| |SequenceFlow|ConditionalSequenceFlow, DefaultSequenceFlow, NormalSequenceFlow| |SubProcess|EventBasedSubProcess| |Gateway|ConvergingGateway, DivergingGateway, MixedGateway, UnspecifiedGateway|"
    description: |
      Beyond BPMN UML diagrams, additional entity classes were extracted from BPMN's natural language
      specifications and formalized. Table 2 shows examples: SequenceFlow spawns 3 subclasses,
      SubProcess adds EventBasedSubProcess, Gateway adds 4 subclasses, EventBasedGateway adds 2 subclasses,
      Event adds multiple subclasses (cancelEvent, conditionalEvent, ErrorEvent, etc.), and Expression
      adds UnderspecifiedExpression. These contribute to the 106 total by making implicit BPMN
      distinctions explicit as ontological classes.
