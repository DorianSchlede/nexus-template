patterns:
  - name: "BPMN 2.0 as State-of-the-Art Meta-Model"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:81-82)"
    quote: "In the literature, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the most adopted meta-model for representing BPs"
    description: "BBO positions BPMN 2.0 as the dominant and most widely adopted meta-model for business process representation. This establishes BPMN as the benchmark against which other BP modeling approaches are compared. The paper explicitly builds BBO by reusing the BPMN 2.0 core, treating it as the industry standard for BP modeling."

  - name: "BPMN Limitations vs Extended Ontology Capability"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:83-88)"
    quote: "BPMN does not support the representation of some process specifications such as the material resources required to carry out a given task, or the workstation where a given task should be performed"
    description: "A critical framework comparison identifying what BPMN cannot capture that BBO extends. BPMN meta-model lacks support for: material resources required by tasks, workstation/location specifications, and complete process specifications. BBO extends BPMN to fill these gaps, demonstrating ontological enrichment over the base standard."

  - name: "EPC vs BPMN Granularity Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:113-114)"
    quote: "BPMN offers a finer grained representation than EPC and an execution logic for its elements"
    description: "Direct comparison between Event Process driven Chain (EPC) and BPMN meta-models. BPMN is positioned as superior due to: (1) finer-grained representation capabilities, and (2) explicit execution semantics for elements. This justifies BBO's choice to build on BPMN rather than EPC as the foundational meta-model."

  - name: "General vs Domain-Specific BP Ontologies"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:115-120)"
    quote: "BP ontologies have often overlapping fragments and are either very general (Uschold et al., 1998; Van Grondelle and Gulpers, 2011; Abdalla et al., 2014), or specific to a given type of processes"
    description: "Framework categorization distinguishing between general-purpose and domain-specific BP ontologies. General ontologies cited include Enterprise Ontology (Uschold 1998). Domain-specific examples include: software project management ontology, software process ontology, industrial maintenance process ontology, and manufacturing process ontology. BBO aims to be a generic ontology that supports fine-grained industrial BP representation."

  - name: "BPMN 1.0 to BPMN 2.0 Evolution Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:123-126)"
    quote: "In (Rospocher, Ghidini and Serafini, 2014), BPMN 1.0 is transformed into an ontology... A more recent and richer version, BPMN 2.0, has been published in 2011. It contains a full formalization of the execution semantics"
    description: "Comparison between BPMN versions showing evolution. BPMN 1.0 ontology by Rospocher et al. was manually revised with annotations and axioms. BPMN 2.0 is characterized as 'richer' with 'full formalization of execution semantics.' BBO explicitly chooses BPMN 2.0 as base due to these improvements."

  - name: "Whole Meta-Model vs Fragment Extraction Approach"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:130-132)"
    quote: "In all these works, the idea was to transform the whole BPMN meta-model into an ontology. This was not our goal. Instead, we extracted a fragment from BPMN that deals with process description"
    description: "Methodological comparison between approaches to ontologizing BPMN. Previous works (Natschlager 2011, BPMN-onto) attempted full meta-model conversion. BBO takes a selective approach: extracting only process-description fragments then extending them. This represents a hybrid methodology combining reuse with targeted extension."

  - name: "BPMN Resource Semantics Ambiguity"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:290-294)"
    quote: "The Resource concept exists in the BPMN meta-model. However, its semantics and definition are ambiguous... the definition of the relation that assigns resources to a process limits the set of resources to the agents"
    description: "Critical analysis of BPMN's Resource class showing internal inconsistency. BPMN p.95 suggests Resource covers all types, but BPMN p.148/152 limits to agents only. BBO resolves this by adopting the broader definition (all resource types) following Karray et al. 2012, diverging from BPMN's practical interpretation."

  - name: "BBO vs BPMN Agent/Resource Interpretation"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:299-300)"
    quote: "Indeed, in (Awad et al., 2009; Stroppi, Chiotti and Villarreal, 2011) Resource in BPMN is equivalent to Agents. In BBO, like in (Karray et al., 2012), we adopt the first definition of Resource"
    description: "Framework comparison on Resource semantics. Awad et al. and Stroppi et al. equate BPMN Resource with Agent. BBO explicitly diverges, following Karray et al.'s broader interpretation where Resource encompasses all types (material, software, human). This allows richer resource taxonomies in BBO."

  - name: "Reuse of External Ontology Fragments"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:117-121)"
    quote: "(Ruiz et al., 2004) propose an ontology for software project management; (Falbo and Bertollo, 2009) also present a software process ontology; (Karray, Chebel-Morello and Zerhouni, 2012) describe an ontology for industrial maintenance processes"
    description: "BBO's relationship to domain-specific ontologies. Rather than competing, BBO reuses fragments from: Ruiz et al. (software project management), Falbo/Bertollo (software process), Karray et al. (industrial maintenance). The Agent sub-ontology comes from Ruiz et al. 2004. Resource taxonomy inspired by Falbo/Bertollo and Karray et al."

  - name: "Manufacturing Facility Ontology Integration"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:309-312)"
    quote: "To specify where the task should be performed, we reused the taxonomies introduced in (Chungoora et al., 2013) and (Fraga, Vegetti and Leone, 2018)"
    description: "Framework integration for manufacturing facility representation. BBO imports spatial concepts from Chungoora et al. (manufacturing system interoperability) and Fraga et al. (industrial product data). Resulting hierarchy: Factory > Shop > Cell > Station. Demonstrates BBO as an integrative ontology drawing from multiple domain sources."

  - name: "UML to OWL Conversion Methodology Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:398-403)"
    quote: "the diagrams and XML schema do not reflect the whole specification and miss a part of its semantics (Dijkman, Dumas and Ouyang, 2008; Wong and Gibbons, 2008)"
    description: "Comparison of formalization approaches. BPMN provides UML diagrams and XML schema, but these miss semantic specifications expressed only in natural language. BBO goes beyond automatic UML-to-OWL conversion by manually extracting and formalizing natural language specifications, achieving greater semantic completeness than purely structural conversions."

  - name: "BBO Entity Count vs Other Frameworks"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO (Chunk 1:471-473)"
    quote: "Concepts: 106 | Relationships others than isA: 125 | isA relations: 83"
    description: "Quantitative framework comparison via schema metrics. BBO contains 106 concepts, 125 non-hierarchical relationships, and 83 isA relations. RD=0.60 indicates rich relationship diversity beyond simple taxonomy. SD=0.78 indicates deep vertical coverage. This positions BBO as a detailed domain ontology rather than a shallow reference model."
