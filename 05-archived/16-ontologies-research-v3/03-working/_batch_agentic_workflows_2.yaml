patterns:
  - name: "Multi-Agent Research Team Assembly"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:127-139)"
    quote: "We have assembled a great team today to answer questions and solve tasks. In attendance are: user, planner, assistant, ontologist, scientist, hypothesis_agent..."
    description: "The SciAgents system explicitly defines a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents are assembled as a 'team' with distinct roles. This includes: user (human-in-the-loop for code execution), planner (task decomposition), assistant (tool calling), ontologist (term definitions), scientist (proposal crafting), and seven specialized expansion agents. This pattern demonstrates hierarchical orchestration with role-based agent specialization."

  - name: "Sequential Agent Orchestration Pipeline"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:142-157)"
    quote: "Overview of the Plan: 1. Generate Random Keywords and Knowledge Path... 2. Define Terms and Relationships... 3. Craft the Research Proposal... 4. Expand the Research Proposal..."
    description: "A structured workflow pipeline where agents execute in sequence: (1) path generation, (2) ontological definition by ontologist, (3) proposal crafting by scientist, (4) parallel expansion by seven specialized agents, (5) critique by critic_agent, (6) novelty/feasibility rating. This demonstrates task decomposition with clear handoff points between agents."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph-Guided Research Generation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:160-165)"
    quote: "Generate Random Keywords and Knowledge Path: Use the generate_path function to generate a knowledge path between two randomly selected keywords."
    description: "Agents leverage a knowledge graph to generate research directions by querying paths between concepts. The generate_path function returns structured relationships that serve as the ontological foundation for research proposal generation. This pattern integrates knowledge graph traversal with agentic reasoning."

  - name: "Ontologist-Scientist Agent Handoff"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:167-182)"
    quote: "Define Terms and Relationships: The ontologist will define each term and discuss the relationships in the generated path. Craft the Research Proposal: The scientist will use the definitions..."
    description: "A strict ordering constraint where the ontologist agent must process knowledge graph output before the scientist agent can proceed. The scientist is explicitly noted as 'ONLY allowed to speak after Ontologist'. This enforces information flow and prevents hallucination by grounding proposals in defined concepts."

  - name: "Seven-Aspect Proposal Expansion Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:185-198)"
    quote: "The hypothesis_agent will expand the 'hypothesis' aspect. The outcome_agent will expand the 'outcome' aspect. The mechanism_agent will expand the 'mechanism' aspect..."
    description: "A parallel fan-out pattern where seven specialized agents simultaneously expand different aspects of a research proposal: hypothesis, outcome, mechanism, design_principles, unexpected_properties, comparison, and novelty. Each agent has a narrow, well-defined scope enabling parallel execution and specialized depth."

  - name: "Critic Agent Synthesis and Improvement"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:200-206)"
    quote: "Critique and Suggest Improvements: The critic_agent will summarize, critique, and suggest improvements to the research proposal."
    description: "A final convergence step where the critic_agent aggregates outputs from all seven expansion agents, synthesizes a summary, provides critical evaluation, and suggests improvements. This implements quality assurance through adversarial review within the multi-agent workflow."

  - name: "Tool-Augmented Agent Functions"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:210-215)"
    quote: "Rate Novelty and Feasibility: Use the rate_novelty_feasibility function to rate the novelty and feasibility of the research idea."
    description: "Agents have access to specialized tool functions (generate_path, rate_novelty_feasibility) that augment their reasoning capabilities. The assistant agent serves as a tool-calling intermediary, invoking functions and returning structured results to other agents in the workflow."

  - name: "Caller Agent as Workflow Controller"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 6:211-224)"
    quote: "caller: I am responsible to pick the next agent to speak. I should be called **immediately** after each output or conversation."
    description: "A dedicated 'caller' agent acts as workflow controller, explicitly managing agent turn-taking and sequencing. This agent must be invoked after every agent output to determine the next speaker, implementing a centralized coordination pattern for multi-agent conversation flow."

  - name: "Human-in-the-Loop Code Execution"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:130-131)"
    quote: "user: An attentive HUMAN user who can answer questions about the task, and can perform tasks such as running Python code or inputting command line commands at a Linux terminal..."
    description: "The workflow explicitly includes a human user agent capable of executing code and terminal commands. This pattern enables the multi-agent system to leverage external computation while maintaining human oversight and the ability to ground agent outputs in real execution results."

  - name: "Literature-Grounded Feasibility Assessment"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 6:141-200)"
    quote: "Literature Search Results: Query 1: 'biomimetic materials microfluidic chips heat transfer performance biocompatibility' Total Results: 36 Relevant Papers..."
    description: "The rate_novelty_feasibility tool performs automated literature search to ground novelty and feasibility ratings in existing research. This pattern prevents agents from generating proposals that duplicate existing work and ensures claims are empirically validated against the scientific record."

  - name: "Quantitative Hypothesis Specification"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 6:362-376)"
    quote: "Hierarchical Structure and Crashworthiness: Rationale... Quantitative Goal: We aim for a 30% increase in crashworthiness... Stiffness Memory: Quantitative Goal: 85% recovery rate..."
    description: "Agents are trained to expand hypotheses with specific quantitative targets (30% increase, 85% recovery rate, 10^6 cycles). This structured output format ensures proposals are testable and measurable, moving beyond vague claims to operationalizable research goals."

  - name: "Multi-Scale Mechanism Decomposition"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 6:632-634)"
    quote: "The anticipated mechanisms underlying the enhanced crashworthiness... involve multi-scale interactions and processes. These mechanisms can be categorized into molecular, cellular, and macroscale levels..."
    description: "Mechanism agents decompose phenomena across multiple scales (molecular, cellular, macroscale), providing detailed explanations at each level. This hierarchical reasoning pattern enables comprehensive mechanism elucidation that spans from fundamental chemistry to emergent material properties."

  - name: "Iterative Design Optimization Loop"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:267-271)"
    quote: "Iterative Design: Optimize the material design based on experimental results and computational predictions. Iterate the design and fabrication process to achieve the desired mechanical properties..."
    description: "Design principles agents specify iterative optimization loops where experimental results feed back into computational models for refinement. This pattern integrates simulation (FEA, MD) with experimental validation in a closed-loop improvement cycle."

  - name: "Unexpected Properties Prediction"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:301-307)"
    quote: "Potential unexpected properties of the hierarchical collagen-based material may arise from the complex interplay between its multi-scale structure... These properties could offer additional benefits and open new avenues..."
    description: "A dedicated unexpected_properties_agent predicts emergent behaviors not explicitly targeted in the hypothesis (self-healing, thermal stability, tunable properties). This speculative reasoning pattern expands the solution space beyond initial requirements to identify potential serendipitous discoveries."

  - name: "Comparative Analysis Framework"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:81-85)"
    quote: "The comparison aspect of this research proposal involves evaluating the novel hierarchical collagen-based material against traditional materials in terms of crashworthiness, stiffness memory, mechanical stiffness, and dynamic adaptability."
    description: "Comparison agents systematically evaluate proposals against multiple baseline categories: traditional materials, natural analogues (nacre), existing solutions, and state-of-the-art alternatives. This structured comparison pattern ensures proposals demonstrate clear advantages over existing approaches."

  - name: "Novelty-Feasibility Rating Protocol"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:442-450)"
    quote: "Novelty: 8/10... The proposed hypothesis is quite novel, especially in the context of combining hierarchical collagen-based materials with dynamic 3D porous architectures... Feasibility: 7/10..."
    description: "A standardized scoring protocol rates proposals on novelty (1-10) and feasibility (1-10) with explicit justification. This quantitative assessment enables comparison across proposals and helps prioritize research directions based on innovation potential and practical achievability."

  - name: "Synthetic Biology Integration Path"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:338-348)"
    quote: "Synthetic Biology Question: Can cell signaling pathways be engineered to dynamically regulate the mechanical properties and self-healing capabilities... Key Steps for Synthetic Biology: 1. Pathway Selection... 2. Genetic Engineering..."
    description: "Research proposals include explicit synthetic biology experimental paths with key steps: pathway selection, genetic engineering (CRISPR), in vitro experiments, property measurement, and optimization. This pattern bridges computational proposals to wet-lab implementation strategies."

  - name: "Gene Circuit-Controlled Material Assembly"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 9:786-788)"
    quote: "Gene Circuits -- controlled expression, secretion, and assembly -- Proteins: Gene circuits can be designed to precisely control the behavior of proteins, including their expression and assembly into structures like amyloid fibrils."
    description: "The multi-agent system proposes using synthetic gene circuits to control protein expression and assembly into functional materials (amyloid fibrils + graphene composites). This pattern demonstrates agentic reasoning about programmable biological systems for materials synthesis."
