  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 4
  - name: "Query Rewriting for Ontology-Guided Retrieval"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:92-109)"
    quote: "Another strategy is to use rules for query rewriting, which given a query, will automatically extend the query in order to find solutions entailed by a set of rules"
    description: "Agents can leverage query rewriting to expand user queries based on ontological rules. The ontology's class hierarchies and inference rules automatically extend queries to retrieve semantically related results. This pattern enables agents to find relevant information even when queries don't use exact ontological terms, supporting ontology-guided reasoning over knowledge graphs."

  - name: "Graph Parallel Frameworks for Agent Analytics"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:496-514)"
    quote: "Various frameworks have been proposed for large-scale graph analytics, often in a distributed (cluster) setting... These graph parallel frameworks apply a systolic abstraction based on a directed graph, where nodes are processors that can send messages to other nodes along edges"
    description: "Graph parallel frameworks like Apache Spark (GraphX), Pregel, and GraphLab provide a computational model where agents can perform distributed reasoning over knowledge graphs. The systolic abstraction enables message-passing between graph nodes, supporting agent-based traversal and aggregation of ontological knowledge at scale."

  - name: "Analytics Combined with Entailment for Agent Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:728-764)"
    quote: "Knowledge graphs are often associated with a semantic schema or ontology that defines the semantics of domain terms, giving rise to entailments... Applying analytics with or without such entailments may yield radically different results"
    description: "Agents querying knowledge graphs must consider ontological entailments to get consistent results. The combination of graph analytics with semantic inference allows agents to analyze the semantic content of knowledge graphs rather than just topological features, enabling semantically-invariant analytics that yield same results over semantically-equivalent graphs."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Agent Plausibility Scoring"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:768-822)"
    quote: "The main goal of knowledge graph embedding techniques is to create a dense representation of the graph in a continuous, low-dimensional vector space that can then be used for machine learning tasks"
    description: "Knowledge graph embeddings enable agents to compute plausibility scores for potential edges, supporting link prediction and confidence assignment. Agents can use these embeddings to evaluate assertions extracted from external sources, complete missing edges, and measure similarity between entities for recommendation or duplicate detection tasks."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 5
  - name: "Entailment-Aware Embeddings for Rule Integration"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-390)"
    quote: "The embeddings thus far consider the data graph alone. But what if an ontology or set of rules is provided? Such deductive knowledge could be used to improve the embeddings"
    description: "Agents can leverage joint embeddings that combine both data graphs and ontological rules. KALE uses t-norm fuzzy logics to integrate rule-based reasoning with embedding plausibility scores. FSL trains relation embeddings while respecting inequalities implied by rules. This interplay between deductive (rules) and inductive (embeddings) knowledge enables more sophisticated agent reasoning."

  - name: "Graph Neural Networks for Supervised Agent Classification"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:393-445)"
    quote: "A graph neural network (GNN) builds a neural network based on the topology of the data graph... Unlike knowledge graphs embeddings, GNNs support end-to-end supervised learning for specific tasks"
    description: "GNNs provide agents with supervised learning capabilities over graph-structured data. Agents can use GNNs to classify graph elements or entire graphs, predict traffic patterns, build recommendations, and even replace traditional graph algorithms for finding central nodes. The GNN topology mirrors the knowledge graph structure, enabling agents to learn task-specific patterns."

  - name: "Symbolic Learning for Interpretable Agent Models"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-696)"
    quote: "An alternative (sometimes complementary) approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that explain a given set of positive and negative edges"
    description: "Symbolic learning enables agents to discover interpretable rules and axioms from knowledge graphs. Unlike numeric embedding models, symbolic models (rules, DL axioms) are interpretable, can be verified by domain experts, and apply to unseen examples through quantification. Agents can use learned rules for deductive reasoning and providing explanations for predictions."

  - name: "Rule Mining for Agent Knowledge Acquisition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:704-770)"
    quote: "Rule mining, in the general sense, refers to discovering meaningful patterns in the form of rules from large collections of background knowledge... The goal of rule mining is to identify new rules that entail a high ratio of positive edges from other positive edges"
    description: "Agents can use rule mining systems like AMIE to automatically discover logical rules from knowledge graphs. Rules are learned with support and confidence measures, enabling agents to identify patterns that generalize well. The Partial Completeness Assumption (PCA) handles incomplete data typical in real-world knowledge graphs."

  # From 03-PROV-AGENT Chunk 1
  - name: "PROV-AGENT Model for Agentic Workflow Provenance"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:30-38)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and data observability to integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance"
    description: "PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV ontology to capture AI agent interactions within agentic workflows. It integrates agent-specific metadata (prompts, responses, decisions) with broader workflow context, enabling end-to-end traceability. This ontological extension allows agents and their actions to be first-class citizens in provenance graphs, supporting hallucination detection and root cause analysis."

  - name: "Agent-Activity-Entity Triad in PROV Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:197-204)"
    quote: "The W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process), with agents representing either software or human actors responsible for activities"
    description: "W3C PROV provides a foundational ontological structure with three core classes: Agent, Entity, and Activity. This Agent-Activity-Entity triad serves as the basis for modeling AI agent interactions. Agents are responsible for activities that use and generate entities, creating a queryable provenance graph for understanding agent behavior."

  - name: "AIAgent as Ontological Extension"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-296)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow provenance graph"
    description: "PROV-AGENT models AIAgent as a subclass of PROV Agent, enabling ontology-guided integration of AI agents into workflow provenance. Agent tools (AgentTool) are associated with AIModelInvocations that use Prompts and generate ResponseData. This ontological structure supports multi-agent scenarios and captures collaborative or parallel agent behaviors."

  - name: "MCP-Based Agent Tool Provenance Capture"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:338-377)"
    quote: "Building on the MCP concepts, when the MCP server is initialized, we begin by creating a new instance of AIAgent... we introduce a new decorator, @flowcept_agent_tool, which creates a corresponding AgentTool execution activity"
    description: "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides standardized concepts for agentic AI development that can be captured in provenance ontology. Agent tools decorated with @flowcept_agent_tool automatically create AgentTool activities linked to executing agents via PROV relationships. This enables runtime capture of agent-ontology interactions."

  - name: "Provenance Queries for Agent Lineage Tracing"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:493-537)"
    quote: "Given an agent decision Agent_Decision_i, the query traverses to its generating Agent_Tool_i, then to the inputs it used... These are traced back through Model_Evaluation_i and Physics_Model_i to the original Sensor_Data_i"
    description: "Ontology-structured provenance enables sophisticated queries for tracing agent decisions. Agents can query their own lineage to understand decision origins, trace error propagation, identify hallucination sources, and understand downstream impacts. The unified provenance graph supports Q&A about agent reasoning, prompt-response relationships, and control flow influence."

  # From 09-OCEL_20_Specification Chunk 4
  - name: "OCEL 2.0 Schema for Object-Event-Agent Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 4:197-331)"
    quote: "We defined a validation schema for the OCEL 2.0 JSON specification... events, objects, eventTypes, objectTypes with relationships and attributes"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 provides a JSON schema that structures object-centric event data with typed events, typed objects, and qualified relationships. Events contain relationships to objects with qualifiers explaining the nature of the relationship. This schema supports agents in understanding process semantics and enables ontology-based extraction and validation of event data."

  - name: "Standard Object and Event Types for AI Integration"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 4:386-405)"
    quote: "We also hope that OCEL 2.0 will also be the basis for creating standard object and event types for different application domains... This creates possibilities for both generative and discriminative Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 aims to standardize object and event types across application domains, enabling AI agents to work with normalized process data. Standard taxonomies of objects/events with inheritance support both generative AI (creating process models) and discriminative AI (classifying process behaviors). Agents can leverage domain-standard ontologies without reinventing definitions."

  # From 10-OC-PM Chunk 2
  - name: "Object-Centric Process Mining with Ontological Metrics"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM (Chunk 2:71-112)"
    quote: "We present some possibilities for conformance checking on top of object-centric event logs... confnum_obj and confdur_lif as the set of events/objects violating the rule"
    description: "Object-centric process mining enables agents to apply conformance checking rules to event logs. Agents can detect anomalies like excessive objects per activity or abnormal lifecycle durations using ontologically-defined constraints. The metrics (CC1, CC2) provide agents with model-independent verification of process properties."

  - name: "Graph Database Queries for Process Mining"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM (Chunk 2:403-418)"
    quote: "In [18,19], the usage of graph databases for the storage, querying, and aggregation of object-centric event data is proposed. An object-centric event log is inserted in the graph by creating nodes for the events, objects, object types"
    description: "Graph databases provide agents with flexible query and aggregation capabilities over object-centric event data. Events, objects, and types become graph nodes with connecting edges based on log content. Ontology-based extraction approaches enable agents to query process data using semantic relationships rather than relational schemas."

  # From 12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data Chunk 1
  - name: "Ontology-Based Data Access for Event Log Extraction"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:426-433)"
    quote: "One noteworthy scientific initiative in this context is ontology-based data access (ODBA) for event log extraction. The approach is based on an ontological view of the domain of interest and linking it as such to a database schema"
    description: "Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) enables agents to extract event logs using ontological mappings to database schemas. Implemented in tools like Onprom, OBDA provides an ontological view of the domain that guides event extraction. Agents can leverage domain ontologies to transform relational data into process-oriented event logs without manual mapping."

  - name: "OCEL Standard for Multi-Case Agent Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:431-433)"
    quote: "Finally, the recently introduced OCEL standard is another relevant piece of work, putting forward a general standard to interchange object-centric event data with multiple case notions"
    description: "The OCEL standard provides agents with a normalized format for object-centric event data supporting multiple case notions simultaneously. Agents can reason across different process perspectives without flattening data to a single case ID. This enables more sophisticated multi-object, multi-process analysis by AI agents."
