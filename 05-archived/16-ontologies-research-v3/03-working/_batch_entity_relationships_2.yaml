  - name: "Quality-Bearer Characterization Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:48-52)"
    quote: "the quality type Flower Color characterizes the object type Flower: characterization(Flower, FlowerColor)"
    description: "UFO defines a characterization relationship where quality types (like FlowerColor) characterize object types (like Flower). This is a structural relationship indicating that instances of the quality type inhere in instances of the object type."

  - name: "Inherence Relationship (Quality to Bearer)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:82-85)"
    quote: "inherence is an existential dependence relation and, hence, the connection between a particular quality and its bearer is immutable"
    description: "In UFO, inherence represents an immutable existential dependence between a quality and its bearer. Once a quality inheres in a bearer, this connection cannot change, though the quality's value can change."

  - name: "HasValue Relationship (Quality to Quality Structure)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:83-86)"
    quote: "the relation of hasValue between a quality and its value (qualia) in a quality structure is one of generic dependence"
    description: "UFO distinguishes hasValue as a generic dependence relation (mutable) from inherence (immutable). A quality's value in a quality structure can change from situation to situation."

  - name: "Role-Person Specialization Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:129-135)"
    quote: "Jogger is a role played by a Person when bearing a Jog mode... Role(Jogger) Jogger < Person"
    description: "UFO models roles as specializations of object kinds that are played when certain mode conditions are met. The Jogger role specializes Person and is played when the Person bears a Jog mode."

  - name: "Mode-Role Characterization Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:143-146)"
    quote: "characterization(Jogger, Jog) forall x. (x :: Jog -> exists!y. (y :: JoggingTrack ^ externallyDependent(x,y)))"
    description: "Modes characterize roles in UFO. The Jog mode characterizes the Jogger role and is externally dependent on a JoggingTrack, showing both characterization and external dependence relationships."

  - name: "Event-Disposition Manifestation Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:149-152)"
    quote: "we have Jogging Events, which are direct manifestations of the dispositions constituting a Jog, and Jogging Processes, which are constituted by Jogging Events"
    description: "Events in UFO are manifestations of dispositions (bundles of moments). Jogging Events manifest dispositions in a Jog mode, while Jogging Processes are constituted by Jogging Events."

  - name: "Process-Event Constitution Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:161-165)"
    quote: "At each situation, we have a particular type of maximal Jogging Process (termed the life of a Jog) that is constituted by (exactly) the sum of Jogging Events"
    description: "UFO defines a constitution relationship between processes and events. A Jogging Process (the life of a Jog) is constituted by exactly the sum of Jogging Events that manifest the underlying Jog mode."

  - name: "Event Temporal Succession (Meet Relationship)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:176-178)"
    quote: "two Jogging Processes that are manifestations of the same Jog and that immediately follow each other, meeting in the Allen sense"
    description: "UFO uses Allen's interval algebra for temporal relationships. Processes that meet in the Allen sense immediately follow each other, and constituents of the preceding process also constitute the succeeding process."

  - name: "Focus Relationship (Event-Endurant)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:251-257)"
    quote: "events cannot genuinely change... Alleged events change are either: (a) event variation... (b) the subject of change is the focus of the event, i.e., the underlying endurant"
    description: "In UFO, events are modally fragile and cannot change. What appears as event change is either variation of temporal parts or change in the underlying endurant (the focus). Events are carved from scenes by their focus."

  - name: "External Dependence Relationship (Mode to Object)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:264-266)"
    quote: "a Walk is modeled as an externally dependent mode that inheres in the Walker and that is externally dependent on Place"

    description: "Knowledge graphs define the fundamental relationship pattern: nodes represent entities, edges represent binary relations between entities. This is the core structural relationship in KGs."

  - name: "Entity-Entity Binary Relation"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:393-400)"
    quote: "the refined, flexible schema that the board ends up with... is modelling a set of binary relations between entities, which indeed can be viewed as modelling a graph"

  - name: "Edge-Label Semantic Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:405-408)"
    quote: "A directed edge-labelled graph... is defined as a set of nodes... and a set of directed labelled edges between those nodes, like Santa Lucia city Santiago"
    description: "In directed edge-labelled graphs, relationships are typed by edge labels. The label (e.g., 'city') defines the semantic nature of the relationship between source and target nodes."

  - name: "Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Edge Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:491-494)"
    quote: "An edge is called homogeneous if it is between two nodes of the same type (e.g., borders); otherwise it is called heterogeneous (e.g., capital)"
    description: "Heterogeneous graphs distinguish edge types based on whether they connect nodes of the same type (homogeneous) or different types (heterogeneous), affecting graph partitioning strategies."

  - name: "Property-Value Annotation Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:549-556)"
    quote: "A property graph allows a set of property-value pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges"

  - name: "Named Graph Container Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:583-609)"
    quote: "A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph. Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph"

    description: "Semantic schema defines subclass relationships enabling type inference. If X is a subclass of Y, then instances of X are also instances of Y (inheritance pattern)."

  - name: "Subproperty Inheritance Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:121-125)"
    quote: "the properties city and venue are sub-properties of a more general property location, such that given an edge Santa Lucia city Santiago... we may also infer that Santa Lucia location Santiago"

  - name: "Shape Target Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:251-258)"
    quote: "A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes. The shape's target can be defined in many ways, such as targetting all instances of a class"
    description: "Validating schemas use shape-target relationships to connect constraint specifications to sets of nodes. Shapes define structural requirements for nodes they target."

  - name: "Shape Inheritance Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:286-288)"
    quote: "Shapes can inherit the constraints of parent shapes - denoted with a triangle connector - as in the case of City and Venue, whose conforming nodes must also conform to the Place shape"

  - name: "Quotient Graph Simulation Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:464-471)"
    quote: "every quotient graph simulates its input graph (based on the simulation relation of set membership between data nodes and quotient nodes)"
    description: "Quotient graphs establish simulation relationships with their source data graphs. For every edge in the data graph, there must be a corresponding edge in the quotient graph preserving structure."

  - name: "Bisimilarity Structural Preservation"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:477-491)"
    quote: "A stronger notion of structural preservation is given by bisimilarity, which... would further require that if [X] y Z is an edge in the quotient graph, then for all x in X, there must exist a z in Z such that [x] y z is in the data graph"
    description: "Bisimilarity defines a stronger structural relationship between graphs than simulation. It requires that quotient graph edges are matched by data graph edges for all partition members."

  - name: "Identity Link (Same-As) Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:690-694)"
    quote: "A second option is to use identity links to state that a local entity has the same identity as another coreferent entity found in an external source; an instantiation of this concept can be found in the OWL standard, which defines the owl:sameAs property"
    description: "Identity links establish coreference relationships between nodes in different graphs. owl:sameAs indicates two identifiers refer to the same real-world entity."

  - name: "Derivation Provenance Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:866-870)"
    quote: "entities (e.g., graphs, nodes, physical document) are derived from other entities, are generated and/or used by activities (e.g., extraction, authorship), and are attributed to agents (e.g., people, software, organisations)"
    description: "PROV Data Model defines provenance relationships: derivation (entity-entity), generation/usage (activity-entity), and attribution (entity-agent). Forms the Agent-Activity-Entity triad."

    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:879-891)"
    quote: "reification, which allows for making statements about statements in a generic manner... RDF reification defines a new node [e] to represent the edge and connects it to the source node (via subject), target node (via object), and edge label (via predicate)"
    description: "Reification creates meta-level relationships, allowing edges to become subjects of other edges. RDF reification uses subject/predicate/object relationships to represent edges as nodes."

  - name: "Rule Body-Head Implication Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:23-31)"
    quote: "A rule is composed of a body (if) and a head (then). Both the body and head are given as graph patterns. A rule indicates that if we can replace the variables of the body with terms from the data graph and form a subgraph... then using the same replacement of variables in the head will yield a valid entailment"
    description: "Rules define conditional relationships between graph patterns. If the body pattern matches, the head pattern is entailed, enabling inference of new relationships from existing ones."
