  # BFO Function, Role, Disposition Paper (06)
  # ========================================

  - name: "Continuant Definition (BFO)"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:54-57)"
    quote: "BFO adopts a view of reality as comprising (1) continuants, entities that continue or persist through time, such as objects, qualities, and functions..."
    description: "BFO defines continuants as entities that persist through time. This includes objects, qualities, and functions. The distinction between continuants (endurants) and occurrents (perdurants) is foundational to BFO's ontological framework."

  - name: "Occurrent Definition (BFO)"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:54-57)"
    quote: "...and (2) occurrents, the events or happenings in which continuants participate."
    description: "Occurrents in BFO are events or happenings that have temporal extension. They are distinguished from continuants in that continuants persist through time while occurrents unfold in time as processes or events."

  - name: "Independent Continuant Definition"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:175-177)"
    quote: "In BFO, all entities are divided into continuants and occurrents. Continuants can be either independent or dependent."
    description: "BFO divides continuants into independent and dependent categories. Independent continuants are the objects we encounter in everyday experience and serve as bearers of dependent continuants."

  - name: "Dependent Continuant via Inherence"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:187-192)"
    quote: "Dependent continuants are related to their bearers by inherence. Inherence is defined as a one-sided, existential dependence relation."
    description: "Dependent continuants (qualities, roles, dispositions, functions) exist only by inhering in independent continuants. The inherence relation is specifically dependent, meaning a quality cannot migrate from one bearer to another."

  - name: "Realizable Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:241-243)"
    quote: "A realizable entity is defined as a specifically dependent continuant that has an independent continuant entity as its bearer, and whose instances can be realized in associated processes."
    description: "Realizable entities are a subtype of dependent continuants that can be manifested in processes. Functions, roles, dispositions, and capabilities are all realizable entities that require processes for their actualization."

  - name: "Role Definition (Externally-Grounded)"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:269-271)"
    quote: "A role is a realizable entity which exists because the bearer is in some special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances in which the bearer does not have to be..."
    description: "Roles are externally-grounded realizable entities. Unlike dispositions, roles depend on external circumstances rather than the bearer's physical makeup. Roles are optional and can be lost without physical change to the bearer."

  - name: "Disposition Definition (Internally-Grounded)"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:333-335)"
    quote: "A disposition is a realizable entity which is such that, if it ceases to exist, then its bearer is physically changed, and whose realization occurs in virtue of the bearer's physical make-up."
    description: "Dispositions are internally-grounded realizable entities. They reflect the in-built physical makeup of the bearer. If a disposition ceases, the bearer is physically changed. Dispositions exist along a strength continuum from weaker forms to sure-fire dispositions."

  - name: "Function Definition (via Evolution/Design)"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:385-388)"
    quote: "A function is a disposition that exists in virtue of the bearer's physical make-up, and this physical make-up is something the bearer possesses because it came into being, either through evolution or through intentional design."
    description: "Functions are dispositions whose bearer's physical makeup came into existence through evolution (biological functions) or intentional design (artifactual functions) to realize processes of a certain sort."

  - name: "Artifactual Function Definition"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:434-436)"
    quote: "An artifactual function is a function whose bearer's physical make-up has been designed and made intentionally (typically by one or more human beings) to function in a certain way."
    description: "Artifactual functions are functions of human-designed artifacts. The bearer's physical makeup was intentionally created to realize certain processes, such as a hammer's function to drive nails."

  - name: "Biological Function Definition"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:449-451)"
    quote: "A biological function is a function whose bearer is part of an organism, and exists and has the physical make-up it has because it has evolved that way and contributes to the organism's realization of a life plan."
    description: "Biological functions are functions of organism parts that evolved to contribute to the organism's life plan. They are attributed to parts of organisms, not whole organisms - the whole organism has roles, not functions."

  # ========================================

  - name: "Continuant vs Occurrent Temporal Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:296-300)"
    quote: "Four-dimensionalists see reality as consisting exclusively of four-dimensional entities (variously referred to as processes, events, occurrents, perdurants, spacetime-worms)."
    description: "BFO reconciles four-dimensionalist (occurrent) and three-dimensionalist (continuant) perspectives in a bicategorial framework. Continuants can have spatial parts but not temporal parts; occurrents can have both spatial and temporal parts."

  - name: "Thing Definition (Continuant/Endurant)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:351-354)"
    quote: "The former [continuants], for Zemach, are defined by the fact that they can be sliced to yield parts only along the spatial dimension - for example those parts of your table which we call its legs, top, nails."
    description: "Continuants (things) can only be sliced spatially, not temporally. Your arms and legs are parts of you, but your childhood is not a part of you - it is part of your life (an occurrent)."

  - name: "Event Definition (Occurrent/Perdurant)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:376-381)"
    quote: "An event is an entity that exists, in its entirety, in the area defined by its spatiotemporal boundaries, and each part of this area contains a part of the whole event."
    description: "Events (occurrents) exist in spatiotemporal regions and can be carved along any spatial and temporal dimensions. Multiple processes can occupy the same spatiotemporal region, unlike Zemach's events."

  - name: "Quality Definition (Dependent Continuant)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:405-409)"
    quote: "BFO generalizes Zemach's idea of a continuant entity by allowing not only things but also entities that are dependent on things, such as qualities and dispositions such as solubility and fragility."
    description: "Qualities are dependent continuants that do not require a process of realization. Unlike realizable entities, qualities exist without needing to be manifested in processes."

  - name: "Process Definition (Change in Continuants)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:689-692)"
    quote: "Processes, in particular, cannot change on the four-dimensionalist view, because processes are changes (they are changes in those independent continuant entities which are their participants)."
    description: "Processes are changes in independent continuant entities. Processes themselves cannot change - they ARE changes. When we 'speed up a process', we ensure a quicker process occurs than would have otherwise."

  - name: "Temporal Part Definition"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:577-583)"
    quote: "a temporal_part_of b =Def. a occurrent_part_of b & for some temporal region r (a spans r & for all occurrents c, r' if (c spans r' & r' occurrent_part_of r) then (c occurrent_part_of a iff c occurrent_part_of b))"
    description: "Temporal parts are occurrent parts that exactly restrict a larger occurrent to a proper temporal region. The first quarter of a football game is a temporal part of the whole game."

  - name: "Determinable vs Determinate Quality Universals"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:500-510)"
    quote: "Qualities instantiate quality universals, which are divided into determinable (such as temperature, length and mass) and determinate (such as 37.0C temperature, 1.6 meter length)."
    description: "Quality universals are divided into determinable (e.g., temperature) and determinate (e.g., 37.0C temperature). Determinable universals are rigid - if exemplified at any time, they are exemplified at all times the bearer exists."

  - name: "Process Profile Definition"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:119-126)"
    quote: "When comparing two heart beating processes as being for example of the same rate, or when comparing two games of chess as consisting of the same series of moves, then there is something in each of the two processes which is qualitatively 'the same'. This something we call a process profile."
    description: "Process profiles are structural dimensions along which processes can be compared. They are what two processes share in common when they have the same rate, series of moves, or other comparable characteristics."

  - name: "Quality Process Profile Definition"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:152-157)"
    quote: "The simplest example of a process profile is that part of a process which serves as the target of selective abstraction focused on a sequence of instances of determinate qualities such as temperature or height."
    description: "Quality process profiles are the simplest type of process profiles, focusing on a sequence of determinate qualities over time. They can be represented by graphs plotting quality measures against time."

  - name: "Rate Process Profile Definition"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:174-179)"
    quote: "Rate process profiles are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate quality magnitudes plotted over successive instants of time, but rather on certain ratios between these magnitudes and associated intervals of elapsed time."
    description: "Rate process profiles focus on ratios between magnitudes and time intervals, such as speed (distance per unit time). They form hierarchies including constant speed, acceleration, and variable acceleration profiles."

  - name: "Cyclical Process Profile Definition"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:238-243)"
    quote: "Cyclical process profiles are a subtype of rate process profiles in which the salient ratio is not distance covered but rather number of cycles per unit of time."
    description: "Cyclical process profiles are rate profiles where the ratio is cycles per unit time. They include regular cyclical profiles (like heartbeats at 60 bpm) and irregular cyclical profiles with diagnostic significance."

    description: "Events in OCEL are discrete, atomic occurrences representing actions/activities in a process. Each event is unique, has a timestamp, may have attributes, and is typed. Events are instantaneous and do not take time."

  - name: "Event Type Definition (Activity)"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:157-161)"
    quote: "Event Types: Events are categorized into different types based on their nature or function. For example, a procurement process might have event types such as Order Created, Order Approved, or Invoice Sent."
    description: "Event types categorize events by their nature or function. Each event belongs to exactly one type. The term 'activity' is sometimes used interchangeably with event type."

  - name: "Object Definition (OCEL)"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:164-167)"
    quote: "Objects: In object-centric process mining, objects represent the entities that are involved in events. These might be physical items like products in a supply chain, or abstract/information entities like orders, invoices, or contracts."
    description: "Objects in OCEL are entities involved in events - either physical (products, machines, workers) or abstract/information entities (orders, invoices, contracts). Objects have typed attributes whose values may change over time."

  - name: "Object Type Definition"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:170-171)"
    quote: "Object Types: Each object is of one type. The object is an instantiation of its type. Object types might include categories like Product, Order, Invoice, or Supplier."

    quote: "Event-to-Object (E2O) Relationships: Events are associated with objects. This relationship describes that an object affects an event or that an event affects an object. Events can be related to multiple objects."
    description: "E2O relationships link events to objects, describing how objects affect events or events affect objects. Unlike traditional logs, events can relate to multiple objects. Relationships can be qualified to describe the object's role."

  - name: "Object-to-Object (O2O) Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:191-194)"
    quote: "Object-to-Object (O2O) Relationships: Objects can also be related to other objects outside the context of an event. For example, an employee may be part of an organizational unit."
    description: "O2O relationships link objects to other objects independent of events. They can be qualified (e.g., part-of, reports-to, belongs-to) and exist outside specific event contexts."

  - name: "Dynamic Object Attribute Values"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:293-297)"
    quote: "Dynamic Object Attribute Values: OCEL 2.0 adopts a dynamic approach where attribute values can change over time. Instead of having a single, fixed value, an object attribute may have a value that changes during the process."
    description: "OCEL 2.0 supports dynamic object attributes that change over time due to events and process progression. This provides a more realistic view of process instances than static attributes."

  - name: "Relationship Qualifiers"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:306-308)"

    quote: "We have a convergence problem when the same event is related to different cases. In event log formats such as XES, this leads to replicating the same event."
    description: "Convergence occurs when the same event belongs to multiple cases, requiring event replication in traditional logs. This falsifies frequencies and introduces false behavioral information."
