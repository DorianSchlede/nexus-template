patterns:
  - name: "Knowledge Graph Definition Categories"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:127-144)"
    quote: "Category I: The first category simply defines the knowledge graph as a graph where nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships..."
    description: "Four categories of knowledge graph definitions are identified: Category I (simple graph with entities and relations), Category II (graph-structured knowledge base), Category III (technical definitions with specific criteria), and Category IV (extensional definitions by example). This shows how different frameworks approach the fundamental definition differently."

  - name: "Paulheim's KG Criteria vs Other Ontologies"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:175-191)"
    quote: "a knowledge graph mainly describes real world entities and their interrelations, organized in a graph; defines possible classes and relations... covers various topical domains"
    description: "Paulheim's four criteria distinguish knowledge graphs from other frameworks: 1) Describes real-world entities in a graph, 2) Has schema for classes and relations, 3) Allows interrelating arbitrary entities, 4) Covers multiple domains. This excludes DOLCE (no instances), WordNet (word senses only), relational databases (schema restrictions), and domain-specific graphs like Geonames."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph vs Ontology Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:196-211)"
    quote: "Ehrlinger and Woss review definitions of 'knowledge graph', where they criticise the Category II definitions based on the argument that knowledge bases are often synonymous with ontologies"
    description: "Ehrlinger and Woss argue that knowledge graphs are distinct from ontologies/knowledge bases. Their definition: 'A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.' This differentiates KGs by their provision of reasoning capabilities."

  - name: "Bellomarin's Semi-Structured Data Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:213-230)"
    quote: "A knowledge graph is a semi-structured data model characterized by three components: (i) a ground extensional component... (ii) an intensional component... (iii) a derived extensional component"
    description: "Bellomarini et al. provide the most detailed technical definition, requiring: ground extensional component (schema and data as graphs), intensional component (inference rules), and derived extensional component (reasoning results). This positions KGs as knowledge bases extended with reasoning."

  - name: "Enterprise KG vs Google KG Compatibility"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:257-283)"
    quote: "Noy et al. states that 'a knowledge graph describes objects of interest and connections between them'... many practical implementations impose constraints on the links"
    description: "Enterprise knowledge graph leaders from eBay, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft define KGs as describing objects and connections, with ontologies usually (but not necessarily) playing a key role. This represents industry consensus that is more permissive than academic Category III definitions."

  - name: "Open KGs vs Linked Data Principles"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:431-455)"
    quote: "By open knowledge graphs, we specifically refer to knowledge graphs published under the Open Data philosophy... Many open knowledge graphs have been published in the form of Linked Open Datasets"
    description: "Open knowledge graphs (DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, Wikidata) follow Linked Data principles and RDF standards. They offer multiple access protocols: dumps (RDF), node lookups (Linked Data), graph patterns (SPARQL), and edge patterns (Triple Pattern Fragments). This contrasts with enterprise KGs which are typically proprietary."

  - name: "DBpedia Multiple Schema Strategy"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:492-502)"
    quote: "Entities within DBpedia are classified using four different schemata... SKOS representation of Wikipedia categories, YAGO classification schema, UMBEL ontology categorisation schema, and a custom schema"
    description: "DBpedia uses multiple concurrent classification schemas to address varying application requirements: SKOS for categories, YAGO for classification, UMBEL for ontology categorization, and custom DBpedia ontology with classes like Person, Place, Organisation. This multi-schema approach contrasts with single-ontology systems."

  - name: "YAGO WordNet Integration Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:505-541)"
    quote: "YAGO likewise extracts graph-structured data from Wikipedia, which are then unified with the hierarchical structure of WordNet to create a 'light-weight and extensible ontology'"
    description: "YAGO integrates Wikipedia infoboxes with WordNet hierarchical concepts to create a lightweight, extensible ontology. The YAGO model provides vocabulary defined in RDFS, supporting reification, n-ary relations, and data types. This hybrid approach (Wikipedia + WordNet) distinguishes it from pure extraction systems."

  - name: "Freebase Loose Typing vs Strict Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:561-576)"
    quote: "the system was implemented as a loose collection of structuring mechanisms... that allowed for incompatible types and properties to coexist simultaneously"
    description: "Freebase deliberately used a loose typing system rather than enforcing ontological correctness or logical consistency. This contrasts with strict ontological approaches like UFO or BFO. Freebase content was later migrated to Wikidata when it became read-only in 2015."

  - name: "Wikidata Multi-Viewpoint Claims"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:600-621)"
    quote: "Wikidata further allows for different viewpoints in terms of potentially contradictory (referenced) claims... Wikidata is multilingual, where nodes and edges are assigned language-agnostic Qxx and Pxx codes"
    description: "Wikidata supports multiple potentially contradictory viewpoints with references, collaborative schema editing, and multilingual language-agnostic identifiers (Qxx, Pxx). This flexible approach differs from foundational ontologies that require logical consistency."

  - name: "Enterprise KG Lightweight Ontologies"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:716-721)"
    quote: "the ontologies used tend to be lightweight, often simple taxonomies representing a hierarchy of classes or concepts"
    description: "Enterprise knowledge graphs from companies like Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Facebook typically use lightweight ontologies (simple taxonomies) rather than complex foundational ontologies. This practical approach contrasts with the rich axiomatization of academic ontologies like UFO or BFO."

  - name: "Semantic Web Standards Foundation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 12:793-811)"
    quote: "Description Logics would be further explored in later years... and formed the underpinnings of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) standard. Together with the Resource Description Framework (RDF)"
    description: "Description Logics underpin OWL, which together with RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, Linked Data principles, and Shape Expressions form the foundational standards for knowledge graphs from the Semantic Web community. Most open KGs have either emerged from this community or adopted its standards."

  - name: "Graph vs Knowledge Base Query Interface"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:108-134)"
    quote: "Compared with the previous protocols, this protocol is much more efficient in terms of bandwidth... However, this reduction in bandwidth use comes at the cost of the server having to evaluate much more complex requests"
    description: "Complex graph pattern queries (like SPARQL) offer bandwidth efficiency by returning only relevant results, but impose higher computational costs on servers. This trade-off differs from simpler node lookup or edge pattern protocols, illustrating how different frameworks balance query complexity and performance."

  - name: "DL Expressivity Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:424-465)"
    quote: "ALC (Attributive Language with Complement) supports atomic classes, the top and bottom classes, class intersection, class union, class negation... S extends ALC with transitive closure"
    description: "Description Logics form a hierarchy of expressivity: ALC as base, S adding transitive closure, with extensions H (relation inclusion), R (complex relations), O (nominals), I (inverse), F/N/Q (cardinality). OWL 2 DL corresponds to SROIQ. This formal hierarchy contrasts with ad-hoc property graph schemas."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Embedding vs Symbolic Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:549-568)"
    quote: "Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey of Approaches and Applications... Embeddings in Table 8 use a variety of operators on vectors, matrices and tensors"
    description: "Knowledge graph embeddings (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, etc.) represent graphs numerically for plausibility scoring and link prediction. This inductive approach contrasts with deductive symbolic reasoning using Description Logics. The survey documents 15+ embedding models with different mathematical formulations."

  - name: "PROV-AGENT Extends W3C PROV"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:119-126)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends the W3C PROV standard and incorporates concepts from the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to represent agent actions"
    description: "PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV by incorporating Model Context Protocol (MCP) concepts for AI agent interactions. This extension adds AgentTool, AIModelInvocation, Prompt, and ResponseData as first-class entities, going beyond traditional workflow provenance."

  - name: "W3C PROV Core Triad"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:197-208)"
    quote: "The W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process)"
    description: "W3C PROV provides the foundational Agent-Activity-Entity triad, similar to the foundational ontology pattern identified in UFO and other frameworks. PROV-AGENT leverages this existing triad for AI agent provenance."

  - name: "PROV Extensions Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:210-246)"
    quote: "PROV-DfA extends PROV to capture human actions in human-steered workflows, while ProvONE adds workflow-specific metadata... PROV-ML combines general workflow concepts with ML-specific artifacts"
    description: "Multiple PROV extensions exist for different domains: PROV-DfA (human actions), ProvONE (workflow metadata), PROV-ML (ML artifacts), FAIR4ML (FAIR principles). PROV-AGENT is positioned as complementary, specifically for AI agents in agentic workflows."

  - name: "AIAgent as W3C PROV Agent Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-296)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow provenance graph"
    description: "AIAgent is modeled as a subclass of W3C PROV Agent, with AgentTool as activities, and DataObject subclasses for prompts, responses, scheduling data, and telemetry. This follows MCP terminology while maintaining PROV compatibility."

  - name: "Agentic Provenance vs Traditional Workflow Provenance"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:168-191)"
    quote: "agentic provenance, i.e., provenance data that track tasks executed by AI agents and their influence on downstream non-agentic tasks and data in the workflows"
    description: "Agentic provenance differs from traditional workflow provenance by capturing agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, decisions) and their influence on downstream tasks. Existing provenance techniques model workflows as static graphs, missing agentic behavior semantics."

  - name: "Historical Knowledge Graph Predecessors"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 12:781-811)"
    quote: "conceptual graphs, semantic networks, and frames were direct predecessors of Description Logics... Description Logics stem from the KL-ONE system proposed by Brachman and Schmolze (1985)"
    description: "Knowledge graphs have historical predecessors: frames (Minsky 1974), semantic networks (Brachman 1977, Woods 1975), conceptual graphs (Sowa 1979), leading to Description Logics (KL-ONE 1985, ALC 1991). This lineage connects modern KGs to decades of knowledge representation research."

  - name: "Pre-2012 KG Definitions vs Modern Practice"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:77-95)"
    quote: "quite a lot of the knowledge graphs defined in this period consider edges as denoting a form of dependence or causality... papers from 1970-2000 tend to have worked with small graphs"
    description: "Pre-2012 knowledge graph definitions often emphasized causal/dependency edges and worked with small graphs from expert elicitation or text extraction. Modern practice involves billions of nodes from diverse structured sources, marking a significant scale and methodology shift."

  - name: "GNN Expressivity vs Description Logic"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:519-527)"
    quote: "Barcelo et al. show that such NRecGNNs have a similar expressiveness for classifying nodes as the ALCQ Description Logic... More expressive GNN variants have been proposed"
    description: "Non-recursive Graph Neural Networks have similar expressiveness to ALCQ Description Logic for node classification. This formal comparison between inductive (GNN) and deductive (DL) approaches provides theoretical grounding for hybrid symbolic-neural systems."
