  # Paper 31: BBO BPMN Ontology - Entity Types
  # ============================================================

  - name: "Process as Key Entity"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:185-187)"
    quote: "Process: it is the key concept. The ontology should enable (i) to represent the decomposition of a given process in activities"
    description: "Process is identified as the central entity type in BBO. It supports hierarchical decomposition into sub-processes and tasks, with ordering constraints controlled by events and conditions. This maps to the Activity entity in the 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Activity Entity Type with Three Subclasses"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:229-234)"
    quote: "Activity is the work to be performed. Activity class has three sub-classes: Task: an atomic task, Sub-Process: complex task that contains several Tasks, CallActivity"
    description: "Activity is defined as the work entity with a clear taxonomy: Task (atomic), Sub-Process (composite), and CallActivity (reusable). This supports the Task entity type in the 8-entity hypothesis with clear atomic/composite distinction."

  - name: "Event Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:236-239)"
    quote: "Event is something that 'happens' during the course of a process. Events affect the flow of the process and usually have a cause or an impact"
    description: "Event is defined as an occurrence that happens during process execution, affecting flow and requiring reactions. This directly validates the Event entity in the 8-entity hypothesis. BPMN distinguishes interrupting vs non-interrupting events and multiple types (TimerEvent, ConditionalEvent, etc.)."

  - name: "Gateway Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:241)"
    quote: "Gateway is used to control how SequenceFlows interact as they converge or diverge within a Process"
    description: "Gateway is a flow control entity type that manages branching and merging of process flows. Four subtypes: ConvergingGateway, DivergingGateway, MixedGateway, UnspecifiedGateway. This relates to Rule entity type as gateways encode decision logic."

  - name: "Agent Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:191-192)"
    quote: "Agent: the actor that performs a given process activity. Indeed, it is important to specify who is responsible for the accomplishment of a given activity"
    description: "Agent is explicitly defined as the actor/performer responsible for activity accomplishment. This directly validates the Agent entity in the 8-entity hypothesis and emphasizes responsibility/accountability."

  - name: "Agent Subclasses - Human and Software"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:346-347)"
    quote: "An Agent may be a HumanResource or a SoftwareResource. The concept Job with the two relations 'subordinated' and 'superior' represent the organizational model"
    description: "Agent is taxonomized into HumanResource and SoftwareResource. This supports AI agent integration patterns where software agents are first-class entities alongside human actors. Job entity captures organizational hierarchy."

  - name: "Role Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:350-353)"
    quote: "we differentiated Job from Role to offer more flexibility. Indeed, two persons that have the same Job, may have different authorization levels to execute Activities"
    description: "Role is explicitly distinguished from Job as an entity type providing authorization levels and activity permissions. Supports indirect assignment of agents to activities via roles. Validates Role entity in 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Resource Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:290-293)"
    quote: "The Resource concept exists in the BPMN meta-model. However, its semantics and definition are ambiguous... we adopt the first definition of Resource, that englobes all resource types"
    description: "Resource is defined broadly to encompass all resource types (not just agents). BBO adopts a comprehensive Resource taxonomy including MaterialResource, SoftwareResource, HumanResource, etc. Validates Resource entity in 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Resource Taxonomy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:300-303)"
    quote: "Hence, we may define a resource taxonomy (Figure 6). This taxonomy actually is relevant to answer to some competency questions like 'What is the type of a given resource?'"
    description: "BBO defines a formal Resource taxonomy with multiple types including MaterialResource, SoftwareResource, ExecutableScript, Tool, DataResource. This provides rich typing for the Resource entity."

  - name: "Input/Output Specifications Entity"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:188-190)"
    quote: "Input/output specifications: tasks may require some input requirements (resources or parameter values) before being performed, or they may produce outcomes"
    description: "InputOutputSpecification is an entity type that captures data flow - what resources/parameters flow into and out of activities. This relates to the Data entity in 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Data Resource Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:282-284)"
    quote: "we need to represent the input and output of each activity. In BPMN meta-model, an activity may have at most one InputOutputSpecification that is related to the required Input/Output Data"
    description: "DataResource is a subtype of Resource representing data objects that flow between activities. Combined with InputOutputSpecification, this validates the Data entity type in 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "WorkProduct Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:326-331)"
    quote: "the term Product is defined as follows 'Thing or substance produced by a natural or artificial process.' We adopt this definition for the WorkProduct concept"
    description: "WorkProduct is an entity type representing outputs of processes. Defined as a subtype of MaterialResource since products can become inputs for subsequent activities. Relates to Data/Resource entities."

  - name: "ManufacturingFacility Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:193-195)"
    quote: "Manufacturing facility: the place where the process activities should be performed"
    description: "ManufacturingFacility is an entity type for location/place where activities occur. Taxonomy includes Station, Cell, Shop, Factory. This could be considered a specialized Resource type."

  - name: "ManufacturingFacility Taxonomy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:311-313)"
    quote: "A workstation, Station, is where a particular job is performed. Cell is the place that groups a set of related operations in the production flow, while Shop is the area where production is carried out"
    description: "ManufacturingFacility has a hierarchical taxonomy: Station (workstation), Cell (grouped operations), Shop (production area), Factory (overall facility). Provides granular location modeling."

  - name: "FlowElement Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:220-223)"
    quote: "Describing a process consists in defining the FlowElements that compose it. FlowElements class has two subclasses: SequenceFlow and FlowNode"
    description: "FlowElement is a supertype for process components with two main subclasses: SequenceFlow (transitions) and FlowNode (activities, events, gateways). This provides structural organization for process entities."

  - name: "SequenceFlow Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:221-222)"

  - name: "FlowElementsContainer Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:220)"
    quote: "Process is a sub-class of FlowElementsContainer. Describing a process consists in defining the FlowElements that compose it"
