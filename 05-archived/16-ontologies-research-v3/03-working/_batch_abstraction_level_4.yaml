patterns:
  - name: "DOLCE Foundational Ontology Status"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:13-23)"
    quote: "DOLCE, the first top-level (foundational) ontology to be axiomatized, has remained stable for twenty years"
    description: "DOLCE is explicitly identified as a foundational (top-level) ontology. Its purpose is to provide general categories and relations needed to give a coherent view of reality, integrate domain knowledge, and mediate across domains. It is not directly concerned with domain knowledge but serves as philosophical grounding for more specific ontologies."

  - name: "Foundational to Domain Ontology Alignment"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:36-38)"
    quote: "when this strategy is applied to foundational ontologies, interoperability is possible also between the domain ontologies aligned to them"
    description: "DOLCE establishes a clear abstraction hierarchy: foundational ontologies enable interoperability between domain ontologies that are aligned to them. This demonstrates the layered abstraction approach where foundational ontologies sit above domain-specific ones."

  - name: "Mesoscopic Level Categories"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:40-43)"
    quote: "such categories are mostly situated at a mesoscopic level, and may change while scientific knowledge or social consensus evolve"
    description: "DOLCE's categories operate at a 'mesoscopic level' - between microscopic physical reality and macroscopic social constructs. This represents a foundational abstraction that captures commonsense human cognition rather than ultimate physical reality."

  - name: "Expressiveness vs Computability Trade-off"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:59-62)"
    quote: "richness greatly enhances expressiveness but, on the other hand, it makes foundational ontologies non computable, due to the well-known trade-off between formal expressiveness and computability"
    description: "Foundational ontologies face an inherent tension between abstraction level and practical use. Rich axiomatization in first-order modal logic provides semantic transparency but requires 'lite' versions for application-oriented languages, creating a cascade of abstraction levels."

  - name: "DOLCE-CORE Terminological Simplification"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 1:87-89)"
    quote: "most basic categories, which in DOLCE were called 'endurant' and 'perdurant' and which become 'object' and 'event' in DOLCE-CORE"
    description: "DOLCE-CORE represents a move toward more intuitive terminology at the foundational level, using 'object' and 'event' instead of 'endurant' and 'perdurant'. This demonstrates how foundational ontologies can provide different terminological abstractions while maintaining the same ontological commitments."

  - name: "Four Design Approaches for DOLCE"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE_Descriptive_Ontology (Chunk 2:468-476)"
    quote: "DOLCE can be used to foster different design approaches: (1) as an upper ontology... (2) as an expressive axiomatic theory... (3) as a coherence/consistency stabilizer... (4) as a source of patterns"
    description: "DOLCE operates at multiple abstraction levels depending on use case: as a minimal upper ontology for agreement, as a detailed axiomatic theory for meaning negotiation, as a consistency checker, or as a source of reusable patterns. This multi-level application distinguishes foundational from domain ontologies."

  - name: "BFO Upper-Level Framework"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:33-37)"
    quote: "Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level framework to assist in the organization and integration of biomedical and other types of information"
    description: "BFO is explicitly positioned as an upper-level (foundational) ontology designed to support integration of data from scientific research. It provides domain-neutral categories that serve as starting points for domain-specific ontology development."

  - name: "BFO Deliberate Minimalism"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:48-52)"
    quote: "BFO is deliberately designed to be very small, so that it may represent in a consistent fashion those upper-level categories common to domain ontologies developed by scientists in different fields"
    description: "BFO's foundational abstraction level is characterized by deliberate minimalism - only 34 terms. This smallness reflects the principle that foundational ontologies should contain only the most general categories, leaving domain-specific concepts to lower-level ontologies."

  - name: "Continuant-Occurrent Top-Level Division"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:54-57)"
    quote: "BFO adopts a view of reality as comprising (1) continuants, entities that continue or persist through time, such as objects, qualities, and functions, and (2) occurrents"
    description: "BFO's foundational abstraction is built on a fundamental dichotomy between continuants (persisting entities) and occurrents (events/processes). This binary division at the highest abstraction level structures all domain-level categorization."

  - name: "Types vs Instances Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:213-217)"
    quote: "The terms used in biological ontologies such as the Gene Ontology refer to types; experiments carried out by biologists in their labs refer to corresponding instances"
    description: "BFO distinguishes between type-level (universal) and instance-level (particular) abstractions. Scientific theories concern types/universals, while experimental data concern instances. This type-instance hierarchy is orthogonal to the foundational-domain hierarchy."

  - name: "BFO Domain-Neutral Starting Point"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:280-284)"
    quote: "Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a domain-neutral resource used by biologists and others to provide a top-level ontology that can serve as a common starting point for the creation of domain ontologies"
    description: "BFO's abstraction level is explicitly 'domain-neutral' - it provides a top-level ontology that serves as a common starting point for domain-specific ontology development across different scientific fields."

  - name: "Bicategorial Three/Four-Dimensionalist Synthesis"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:339-342)"
    quote: "BFO, in contrast, is founded on a bicategorial approach which seeks to combine elements of both the three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives"
    description: "BFO operates at a foundational abstraction level that synthesizes two competing philosophical frameworks (3D continuants and 4D occurrents) into a single coherent framework. This represents a high-level ontological decision that constrains all downstream domain modeling."

  - name: "Aristotle's Ontological Square in BFO"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:447-452)"
    quote: "BFO draws on Aristotle's ideas concerning the division of substances and accidents, which reappears in BFO as the division between independent and dependent continuants"
    description: "BFO's foundational abstraction recapitulates Aristotle's ontological square: substances/accidents crossed with universals/particulars. This philosophical grounding places BFO at the most abstract metaphysical level."

  - name: "Process Universals Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:182-197)"
    quote: "we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive levels, including: speed profile, constant speed profile, 2 mph constant speed profile..."
    description: "Within the occurrent branch, BFO allows for hierarchical abstraction of process types from determinable (speed profile) to determinate (2 mph constant speed profile). This demonstrates how foundational categories enable increasingly specific domain categorization."

  - name: "OCEL Paradigm Shift from Case-Centric"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:134-141)"
    quote: "Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) represents a paradigm shift, intended to address and overcome the inherent limitations of traditional case-centric process mining methods"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 represents a domain-level abstraction for process mining that moves from case-centric to object-centric modeling. This is an application-level ontology designed for a specific domain (process mining) rather than a foundational ontology."

  - name: "OCEL Metamodel Core Entities"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:149-171)"
    quote: "Events: Object-centric process mining works on discrete events... Event Types: Events are categorized into different types... Objects: In object-centric process mining, objects represent the entities"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 defines a domain-specific metamodel with core entities: Events, Event Types, Objects, Object Types, and their relationships. This is a domain/application level abstraction specifically designed for process mining, not a foundational ontology."

  - name: "Object-Centric Event Log Definition"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:79-84)"
    quote: "Object-centric event logs have been proposed to resolve the convergence and divergence problems... where each event is related to different objects of different types"
    description: "Object-centric event logs represent a domain-level abstraction that resolves problems inherent in case-centric abstractions. This is an application-level ontological choice specific to process mining, demonstrating how domain ontologies make different abstraction decisions than foundational ones."

  - name: "Flattening as Abstraction Transformation"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:555-561)"
    quote: "A flattening operation transforms the object-centric event log into a traditional event log given the choice of an object type. This is useful because many process mining approaches are only available for traditional event logs"
    description: "The 'flattening' operation demonstrates abstraction level transformation - converting richer object-centric representations to simpler case-centric ones. This shows how domain ontologies can move between abstraction levels based on analytical needs."
