patterns:
  - name: "Knowledge Graph vs Data Graph Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:78-86)"
    quote: "We refer to a knowledge graph as a data graph potentially enhanced with representations of schema, identity, context, ontologies and/or rules"
    description: "The paper establishes a fundamental distinction between data graphs and knowledge graphs. A data graph is a collection of data represented as nodes and edges. A knowledge graph extends this with schema, identity, context, ontologies, and rules. This provides a framework for comparing different graph-based systems based on what additional layers they support beyond raw data."

  - name: "Schema Types Taxonomy - Semantic vs Validating vs Emergent"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:96-98)"
    quote: "We discuss three types of graph schemata: semantic, validating, and emergent"
    description: "Framework comparison pattern identifying three fundamentally different approaches to schema in graph systems: semantic schema (defines meaning of terms for reasoning), validating schema (prescribes constraints for validation), and emergent schema (automatically extracted structure). Different frameworks may implement one or more of these schema types."

  - name: "RDFS as Semantic Schema Standard"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:176-178)"
    quote: "A prominent standard for defining a semantic schema for (RDF) graphs is the RDF Schema (RDFS) standard, which allows for defining subclasses, subproperties, domains, and ranges"
    description: "RDFS is positioned as the foundational standard for semantic schema in RDF graphs. Comparison point: RDFS provides basic semantic features (subclass, subproperty, domain, range) while OWL extends this with richer semantics. This establishes a hierarchy of semantic expressiveness in ontology standards."

  - name: "OWL Extension of RDF Schema Semantics"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:187-190)"
    quote: "the semantics of terms used in a graph can be defined in much more depth than seen here, as is supported by the Web Ontology Language (OWL) standard for RDF graphs"
    description: "OWL is compared to RDFS as providing deeper semantic definition capabilities. This positions OWL as the more expressive choice when comparing ontology languages for knowledge graphs, supporting features beyond basic class/property hierarchies."

  - name: "Open vs Closed World Assumption Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:198-210)"
    quote: "if the Closed World Assumption (CWA) were adopted... it would be assumed that the data graph is a complete description of the world... Systems that do not adopt the CWA are said to adopt the Open World Assumption (OWA)"
    description: "Critical framework comparison dimension: CWA vs OWA determines how missing information is interpreted. CWA (classical databases) assumes missing = false. OWA (semantic web, OWL) assumes missing = unknown. LCWA provides middle ground. This fundamentally affects reasoning and query behavior across different frameworks."

  - name: "ShEx vs SHACL for Validating Schema"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:380-394)"
    quote: "Two shapes languages have recently emerged for RDF graphs: Shape Expressions (ShEx), published as a W3C Community Group Report; and SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language), published as a W3C Recommendation"
    description: "Comparison of two competing standards for validating schemas in RDF graphs. Both support shapes-based validation with different expressiveness trade-offs. ShEx is community-driven while SHACL is a full W3C Recommendation. A common basis language has been proposed revealing their similarities and differences."

  - name: "Property Graphs Schema Proposal"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:393-395)"
    quote: "A similar notion of schema has been proposed by Angles for property graphs"
    description: "Comparison showing that validating schema concepts (shapes) developed for RDF graphs are being adapted to property graphs, indicating convergence of concepts across different graph data models."

  - name: "Quotient Graph Framework for Emergent Schema"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:438-441)"
    quote: "A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some equivalence relation"
    description: "Quotient graphs provide a mathematical framework for emergent/summary schema. This contrasts with manually-defined semantic and validating schemas. The framework preserves structural properties through simulation or bisimulation relations."

  - name: "Simulation vs Bisimulation for Schema Preservation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:463-477)"
    quote: "every quotient graph simulates its input graph... A stronger notion of structural preservation is given by bisimilarity"
    description: "Framework comparison for emergent schema quality: simulation provides weaker guarantees than bisimilarity. Bisimilar quotient graphs preserve forward-directed paths exactly, making them more reliable for schema summarization but potentially larger."

  - name: "PROV Data Model for Provenance Context"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:864-870)"
    quote: "Another example is the PROV Data Model, which specifies how provenance can be described in RDF graphs, where entities are derived from other entities, are generated and/or used by activities, and are attributed to agents"
    description: "PROV Data Model is compared as the standard for representing provenance context in knowledge graphs. It establishes the Entity-Activity-Agent triad for provenance, providing a reference framework for comparing provenance modeling approaches."

  - name: "Reification Alternatives Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:886-905)"
    quote: "In Figure 18 we present three forms of reification... RDF reification, n-ary relations, and singleton properties"
    description: "Three competing approaches for reifying edges to add context: (1) RDF reification (node represents edge with subject/object/predicate), (2) n-ary relations (source node connects directly to edge node), (3) singleton properties (edge label connects to original label). Each has different trade-offs for expressiveness and query complexity."

  - name: "Higher-Arity Representations - Named Graphs vs Property Graphs vs RDF*"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:8-22)"
    quote: "First, we can use a named graph... Second, we can use a property graph where the temporal context is defined as an attribute on the edge. Third, we can use RDF*"
    description: "Comparison of three higher-arity representation options for modeling context. Named graphs are most flexible (can assign context to multiple edges at once). Property graphs provide natural edge attributes. RDF* is least flexible (cannot pair different contextual values). This informs graph model selection based on context requirements."

  - name: "Annotated RDF and Semi-Ring Framework"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:120-126)"
    quote: "Annotated RDF allows for representing various forms of context modelled as semi-rings: algebraic structures consisting of domain values and two main operators to combine domain values: meet and join"
    description: "Annotated RDF provides a mathematical framework (semi-rings) for domain-independent context modeling with meet/join operations. This compares to domain-specific approaches like Temporal RDF or Fuzzy RDF by offering a general algebraic structure for context combination."

  - name: "OWL Influence from Description Logics"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:349-356)"
    quote: "Amongst the most popular ontology languages used in practice are the Web Ontology Language (OWL), recommended by the W3C... and the Open Biomedical Ontologies Format (OBOF), used mostly in the biomedical domain"
    description: "Comparison of two major ontology languages: OWL (general purpose, W3C standard) and OBOF (domain-specific, biomedical). OWL is more widely adopted while OBOF is specialized. Both share many similar features despite different origins."

  - name: "NUNA vs UNA Assumption Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:413-428)"
    quote: "under the Unique Name Assumption (UNA), the data graph describes at least two flights to Santiago... Conversely, under No Unique Name Assumption (NUNA), we can only say there is at least one such flight"
    description: "Framework comparison on identity assumptions: UNA assumes different names = different entities (allows counting). NUNA allows same entity to have multiple names (more general). OWL adopts NUNA requiring explicit same-as/different-from statements. This affects entity counting and reasoning behavior."

  - name: "OWL 2 DL as Decidable Fragment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:176-181)"
    quote: "the OWL standard was heavily influenced by DLs, where, for example, the OWL 2 DL language is a fragment of OWL restricted so that entailment becomes decidable"
    description: "Framework comparison showing OWL 2 DL as a restricted fragment of full OWL designed for decidable reasoning. This illustrates the trade-off between expressiveness and computability in ontology language design."

  - name: "Description Logic Family and FOL Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:139-147)"
    quote: "DLs form a family of logics rather than a particular logic. Initially, DLs were restricted fragments of First Order Logic (FOL) that permit decidable reasoning tasks"
    description: "Description Logics are positioned as a family of logics balancing expressiveness and computational complexity. They originated as FOL fragments but have been extended with features beyond FOL (transitive closure, datatypes). Different DLs serve different use cases."

  - name: "OWL 2 RL for Rule-Based Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:44-46)"
    quote: "A more comprehensive set of rules for the OWL features of Tables 3-5 have been defined as OWL 2 RL/RDF"
    description: "OWL 2 RL is compared as the OWL profile designed for rule-based reasoning systems. It provides rules to capture OWL semantics but is incomplete for negation, existentials, universals, and counting. Comparison point for reasoning approaches."

  - name: "OWL 2 QL for Query Rewriting"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:107-109)"
    quote: "The OWL 2 QL profile is a subset of OWL designed specifically for query rewriting of this form"
    description: "OWL 2 QL is compared as the OWL profile optimized for query rewriting approaches. It sacrifices expressiveness for efficient query-time reasoning by rewriting queries rather than materializing inferences."

  - name: "Rule Languages Comparison - N3, RIF, SWRL, SPIN"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:120-124)"
    quote: "Various languages allow for expressing rules over graphs... including: Notation3 (N3), Rule Interchange Format (RIF), Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), and SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN)"
    description: "Comparison of four rule languages for expressing graph-based rules: N3 (Notation3), RIF (W3C standard for rule interchange), SWRL (combining OWL with rules), and SPIN (SPARQL-based inference). Each serves different integration needs with ontology languages."

  - name: "Datalog Extensions for Graph Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:51-52)"
    quote: "Other rule languages have, however, been proposed to support additional such features, including existentials (see, e.g., Datalog plus/minus), disjunction (see, e.g., Disjunctive Datalog)"
    description: "Datalog variants compared for handling features OWL 2 RL cannot capture: Datalog+/- supports existential rules, Disjunctive Datalog supports disjunction. These extend classical Datalog to handle more expressive ontological reasoning."

  - name: "Inductive Techniques Taxonomy"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:230-271)"
    quote: "In Figure 23 we provide an overview of the inductive techniques typically applied to knowledge graphs... graph analytics... knowledge graph embeddings... graph neural networks... symbolic learning"
    description: "Comprehensive framework comparison of inductive learning approaches for knowledge graphs: (1) Graph Analytics (unsupervised, topology-based), (2) KG Embeddings (self-supervised, numeric models), (3) GNNs (supervised, neural), (4) Symbolic Learning (self-supervised, logical models). Each serves different purposes."

  - name: "Graph Parallel Frameworks Comparison"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:496-500)"
    quote: "Various frameworks have been proposed for large-scale graph analytics... including Apache Spark (GraphX), GraphLab, Pregel, Signal-Collect, Shark"
    description: "Comparison of distributed graph processing frameworks: GraphX (Apache Spark), GraphLab, Pregel (Google), Signal-Collect, Shark. All use systolic abstraction where nodes pass messages along edges. Choice affects scalability and available operations."

  - name: "TransE vs Variants for Embedding Models"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:36-60)"
    quote: "TransE can be too simplistic... many variants of TransE have been investigated. Amongst these, for example, TransH represents different relations using distinct hyperplanes... TransR... TransD... RotatE"
    description: "Framework comparison of translational embedding models: TransE (basic, es+rp=eo), TransH (hyperplane projections), TransR (relation-specific spaces), TransD (simplified projection), RotatE (complex space, captures symmetry/inversion). Each addresses different limitations of predecessors."

  - name: "Tensor Decomposition Models - CP vs Tucker"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:194-237)"
    quote: "DistMult is a seminal method... RESCAL uses a matrix... HolE uses vectors... ComplEx uses a complex vector... SimplE... TuckER employs a different type of decomposition called Tucker Decomposition"
    description: "Comparison of tensor decomposition embedding approaches: DistMult (symmetric CP), RESCAL (matrix relations), HolE (circular correlation), ComplEx (complex numbers), SimplE (averaged CP), TuckER (Tucker decomposition - current SOTA). Trade-offs between parameter count and expressiveness."

  - name: "Word2Vec vs GloVe for Language Model Embeddings"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:294-306)"
    quote: "word2vec and GloVe being two seminal approaches. Both approaches compute embeddings for words based on large corpora of text... Word2vec uses neural networks... GloVe rather applies a regression model"
    description: "Comparison of foundational language embedding techniques adapted for graphs: Word2Vec (neural, predict surrounding words), GloVe (regression on co-occurrence). RDF2Vec adapts Word2Vec for graphs via random walks, KGloVe adapts GloVe using PageRank for relatedness."

  - name: "RecGNN vs ConvGNN Architectures"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:635-643)"
    quote: "There are two main differences between RecGNNs and ConvGNNs. First, RecGNNs aggregate information from neighbours recursively up to a fixpoint, whereas ConvGNNs typically apply a fixed number of convolutional layers"
    description: "Framework comparison of graph neural network architectures: RecGNNs (recursive to fixpoint, same function/parameters), ConvGNNs (fixed layers, different kernels per layer). ConvGNNs avoid convergence restrictions of RecGNNs but may miss global patterns."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-695)"
    quote: "knowledge graph embeddings might predict the edge SCL flight ARI as being highly plausible, but they will not provide an interpretable model... An alternative approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language"
    description: "Fundamental framework comparison: numeric embeddings (accurate but uninterpretable, out-of-vocabulary problem) vs symbolic learning (interpretable, generalizable rules but may miss subtle patterns). Combining both offers complementary strengths."

  - name: "AMIE vs DL-Learner for Rule Mining"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:959-975)"
    quote: "Other systems propose methods to learn more general axioms. A prominent such system is DL-Learner, which is based on algorithms for class learning (aka concept learning)"
    description: "Comparison of symbolic learning systems: AMIE (mines Horn-like rules using refinement operators and PCA confidence), DL-Learner (learns DL class descriptions using concept learning). AMIE targets rules, DL-Learner targets more expressive axioms."

  - name: "Differentiable vs Discrete Rule Mining"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:866-909)"
    quote: "While the previous works involve discrete expansions of candidate rules... another line of research is on a technique called differentiable rule mining, which allows end-to-end learning of rules"
    description: "Comparison of rule mining paradigms: discrete expansion (AMIE-style, explicit rule generation and scoring) vs differentiable (NeuralLP, DRUM - represent rules as matrix operations, learn via attention). Differentiable currently limited to path-like rules."

  - name: "R2RML Standard for Database to Graph Mapping"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:649-660)"
    quote: "A standard language along these lines is the RDB2RDF Mapping Language (R2RML), which allows for mapping from individual rows of a table to one or more custom edges"
    description: "R2RML is positioned as the standard for custom database-to-RDF mapping, compared to direct mapping (automatic, preserves information) vs custom mapping (manual, allows alignment with existing vocabularies). R2RML supports templates and SQL queries for complex transformations."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:765-800)"
    quote: "Early methodologies were often based on a waterfall-like process... more iterative and agile ways of building and maintaining ontologies have been proposed. DILIGENT was an early example... More modern agile methodologies include eXtreme Design (XD), Modular Ontology Modelling (MOM), SAMOD"
