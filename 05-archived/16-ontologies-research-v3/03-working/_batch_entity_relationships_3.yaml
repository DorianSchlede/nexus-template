  - name: "Translational Edge Transformation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:7-12)"
    quote: "Translational models interpret edge labels as transformations from subject nodes (aka the source or head) to object nodes (aka the target or tail)"
    description: "Edge labels in knowledge graphs represent transformations between entities. The relationship between source and target nodes is modeled as a vector transformation where edge labels act as translation operators. This is fundamental to the Agent-Activity-Entity triad where Activities transform entity states."

  - name: "Entity-Relation Vector Embedding"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:12-14)"
    quote: "Over all positive edges [s] p -, TransE learns vectors es, rp, and eo aiming to make es + rp as close as possible to eo"
    description: "Entity relationships are encoded as vector arithmetic where the subject entity vector plus the relation vector approximates the object entity vector. This mathematical formalization of relationships enables computational reasoning over entity connections."

  - name: "Relation-Specific Vector Spaces"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:42-44)"
    quote: "TransR generalises this approach by projecting [s] and [o] into a vector space specific to p, which involves multiplying the entity embeddings for [s] and [o] by a projection matrix specific to p"
    description: "Different relationship types can have their own distinct vector spaces. Entities are projected into relation-specific spaces for computing relationship plausibility, allowing relationships to have semantically distinct characteristics (structural, behavioral, temporal)."

  - name: "Relation Symmetry and Direction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:50-52)"
    quote: "RotatE proposes translational embeddings in complex space, which allows to capture more characteristics of relations, such as direction, symmetry, inversion, antisymmetry, and composition"
    description: "Entity relationships possess inherent properties including directionality (one-way vs bidirectional), symmetry (if A relates to B, does B relate to A?), and composition (chaining relationships). These properties are critical for modeling real-world entity interactions."

  - name: "Graph Tensor Decomposition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:178-184)"
    quote: "a graph can be encoded as a one-hot 3-order tensor G with |V| x |L| x |V| elements, where the element (G)ijk is set to one if the ith node links to the kth node with an edge having the jth label"
    description: "The complete set of entity relationships in a knowledge graph can be represented as a 3-dimensional tensor: entities x relationship-types x entities. This provides a formal mathematical structure for all relationships in the graph."

  - name: "Bilinear Relationship Scoring"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:194-198)"

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:427-431)"
    quote: "A graph neural network (GNN) builds a neural network based on the topology of the data graph; i.e., nodes are connected to their neighbours per the data graph"
    description: "In GNNs, the structural relationships between entities define the neural network architecture itself. Node connections in the knowledge graph become neural connections, making entity relationships fundamental to the computational structure."

  - name: "Entity State Propagation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:470-476)"
    quote: "Each node in the graph is also associated with a state vector, which is recursively updated based on information from the node's neighbours - i.e., the feature and state vectors of the neighbouring nodes and the feature vectors of the edges extending to/from them"
    description: "Entity states are defined and updated through their relationships with neighboring entities. The relationship structure mediates information flow between entities, with edge features carrying relationship semantics."

  - name: "Transition and Output Functions"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:476-480)"
    quote: "using a parametric function, called the transition function. A second parametric function, called the output function, is used to compute the final output for a node based on its own feature and state vector"
    description: "Two types of functions govern entity behavior in graph neural networks: transition functions that propagate state through relationships, and output functions that derive results. This parallels the Agent-Activity-Entity pattern where Activities transform entities."

  - name: "Neighbourhood-Based Node Classification"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:582-584)"
    quote: "we may define neighbouring nodes differently, for example to include nodes for outgoing edges, or nodes one or two hops away"
    description: "Entity types and properties can be determined by their relationship neighborhoods. The pattern of connections an entity has (structural, incoming, outgoing, multi-hop) defines its classification and role in the knowledge graph."

  - name: "Rule Entailment from Edges"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:667-678)"
    quote: "The hypotheses then serve as interpretable models that can be used for further deductive reasoning. Given the graph of Figure 30, we may, for example, learn the rule [?x] flight ?y => [?y] flight ?x from observing that flight routes tend to be return routes"
    description: "Relationship patterns between entities can be learned as logical rules. These rules capture systematic patterns in how entities relate (e.g., symmetric relationships like 'flight'), enabling inference of new relationships from existing ones."

  - name: "Rule-Based Relationship Inference"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:680-690)"
    quote: "we might learn a DL axiom stating that airports are either domestic, international, or both: Airport subc DomesticAirport union InternationalAirport"
    description: "Entity classification relationships (type/subtype) can be mined from the knowledge graph structure. Entities are organized into taxonomic hierarchies where relationships define class membership and inheritance."

  - name: "Positive and Negative Edge Sets"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:706-712)"
    quote: "we assume a set of positive and negative edges as given. Typically positive edges are observed edges (i.e., those given or entailed by a knowledge graph) while negative edges are defined according to a given assumption of completeness"
    description: "Entity relationships are categorized as positive (existing/true) or negative (non-existing/false). This binary classification of relationships enables supervised learning of relationship patterns."

  - name: "Rule Support and Confidence"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:738-744)"
    quote: "The number of entailments that are positive is called the support for the rule, while the ratio of a rule's entailments that are positive is called the confidence for the rule"
    description: "Relationship patterns (rules) are evaluated by two metrics: support (how many entity pairs follow the pattern) and confidence (what proportion of applicable cases follow the pattern). These metrics quantify the strength of relationship patterns."

  # CHUNK 6 PATTERNS (02-Knowledge_Graphs_6.md)

  - name: "Partial Completeness Assumption"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:756-764)"
    quote: "A common heuristic is to adopt a Partial Completeness Assumption (PCA), which considers the set of positive edges to be those contained in the data graph, and the set of negative examples to be the set of all edges x p y' not in the graph but where there exists a node y such that x p y is in the graph"
    description: "For relationship learning, negative relationships are defined relative to known positive relationships. If an entity has a relationship of type P with some entity, then missing P-relationships are considered negative. This models relationship completeness at the entity level."

  - name: "Rule Refinement Operations"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:86-95)"
    quote: "three types of refinements are considered, each of which adds a new edge to the body of the rule. This new edge takes an edge label from the graph and may otherwise use fresh variables not appearing previously in the rule, existing variables that already appear in the rule, or nodes from the graph"
    description: "Relationship rules are constructed iteratively by adding edge patterns. New edges can connect existing variables, introduce new variables, or reference specific entities, building complex multi-hop relationship patterns."

  - name: "Closed Rule Constraint"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:116-123)"
    quote: "a rule must be closed, meaning that each variable appears in at least two edges of the rule, which ensures that rules are safe, meaning that each variable in the head appears in the body"
    description: "Valid relationship rules require that every entity variable participates in at least two relationships. This ensures that inferred relationships are grounded in multiple observable relationship patterns."

  - name: "Non-Monotonic Rules with Exceptions"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:130-140)"
    quote: "Gad-Elrab et al. propose a method to learn non-monotonic rules - rules with negated edges in the body - in order to capture exceptions to base rules"
    description: "Relationship patterns can include negative conditions (absence of relationships). Rules like 'flights within same country are domestic EXCEPT when departure airport is international' capture conditional relationship semantics."

  - name: "Disjointness Axiom Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:19-26)"
    quote: "the disjointness axiom DomesticAirport intersect InternationalAirport equiv Bottom states that the intersection of the two classes is equivalent to the empty class, or in simpler terms, no node can be simultaneously of type [Domestic Airport] and [International Airport]"
    description: "Entity types can have mutually exclusive (disjoint) relationships. An entity cannot simultaneously belong to disjoint classes, constraining the space of valid entity-type relationships."

  - name: "Class Learning from Positive/Negative Sets"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:59-70)"
    quote: "class learning (aka concept learning), whereby given a set of positive nodes and negative nodes, the goal is to find a logical class description that divides the positive and negative sets"
    description: "Entity classifications can be learned by finding relationship-based descriptions that distinguish positive from negative entity sets. Classes are defined by the patterns of relationships their members exhibit."

  - name: "Named Entity Recognition Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:205-210)"
    quote: "The NER task identifies mentions of named entities in a text, typically targetting mentions of people, organisations, locations, and potentially other types"
    description: "Entity extraction from text identifies typed entities (Person, Organization, Location) that can participate in relationships. The entity types constrain what relationships are applicable."

  - name: "Entity Linking to Knowledge Graph"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:233-240)"
    quote: "The EL task associates mentions of entities in a text with the existing nodes of a target knowledge graph, which may be the nucleus of a knowledge graph under creation, or an external knowledge graph"
    description: "Entities mentioned in text are linked to canonical entities in knowledge graphs, establishing identity relationships. This enables integration of relationships from multiple sources about the same entity."

  - name: "Relation Extraction Binary and N-ary"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:274-277)"
    quote: "The RE task extracts relations between entities in the text. The simplest case is that of extracting binary relations in a closed setting wherein a fixed set of relation types are considered"
    description: "Relationships are extracted between entities identified in text. Binary relations connect two entities; n-ary relations (like events with participants) involve multiple entities in structured relationships."

  - name: "Reification for Higher-Arity Relations"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:300-305)"
    quote: "an n-ary relation captures additional temporal context, denoting when Rapa Nui was named a World Heritage site; in this case, an anonymous node is created to represent the higher-arity relation in the directed-labelled graph"
    description: "Complex relationships involving multiple entities or contextual information are modeled using reification - creating intermediate nodes that have relationships to all participants. This enables representing events, processes, and temporal relationships."

  - name: "Direct Mapping from Tables"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:597-604)"
    quote: "A direct mapping automatically generates a graph from a table. creates an edge [x] y z for each (non-header, non-empty, non-null) cell of the table, such that [x] represents the row of the cell, y the column name of the cell, and [z] the value of the cell"
    description: "Tabular data maps to entity relationships where rows become entities, columns become relationship types, and cell values become related entities or values. This formalizes structured data as a relationship graph."

  - name: "Foreign Key as Entity Reference"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:615-621)"
    quote: "In case of a foreign key between two tables - such as Report.claimant referencing Claimant.id - we can link, for example, to [Claimant-XY12SDA] rather than [XY12SDA], where the former node also has the name and country of the claimant"
    description: "Database foreign keys become explicit entity relationships in knowledge graphs. The referential integrity constraint in relational data becomes a typed edge connecting two entity nodes."

  - name: "Ontology-Based Data Access"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:89-96)"
    quote: "The area of Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) is then concerned with QR approaches that support ontological entailments as discussed in Section 4. Although most QR approaches only support non-recursive entailments expressible as a single (non-recursive) query"
    description: "Entity relationships defined in ontologies enable query rewriting over data sources. Ontological axioms about relationships (subclass, subproperty, domain, range) allow inferring additional relationships during query answering."

  - name: "Completeness Dimensions"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:97-108)"
    quote: "Completeness comprises the following aspects: (i) schema completeness refers to the degree to which the classes and properties of a schema are represented in the data graph, (ii) property completeness refers to the ratio of missing values for a specific property"
    description: "Entity relationship quality is measured along multiple dimensions: schema completeness (are all relationship types represented?), property completeness (are all relationships of a type populated?), population completeness (are all entities present?), and linkability (are entities properly connected?)."

  - name: "Geographic and Social Biases"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:126-138)"
    quote: "Examples of data biases include geographic biases that under-represent entities/relations from certain parts of the world, linguistic biases that under-represent multilingual resources, social biases that under-represent people of particular genders or races"
    description: "Entity relationship coverage may exhibit systematic biases - certain entity types, geographic regions, or demographic groups may be under-represented in relationships, affecting the completeness and fairness of knowledge graph applications."

  - name: "Consistency via Logical Entailment"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:168-176)"
    quote: "Consistency means that a knowledge graph is free of (logical/formal) contradictions with respect to the particular logical entailment considered. not condition can give rise to inconsistencies if the negated condition is entailed"
    description: "Entity relationships must be logically consistent - no set of relationships should entail contradictions. Inconsistencies arise when relationship constraints (like disjointness or cardinality) are violated."

  - name: "Shape-Based Validity Constraints"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:179-192)"
    quote: "Validity means that the knowledge graph is free of constraint violations, such as captured by shape expressions. We may, for example, specify a shape City whose target nodes have at most one country"

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:27-38)"
    quote: "Protocols for performing node lookups accept a node (id) request and return a (sub-)graph describing that node. a common convention is to return a sub-graph containing either all outgoing edges for that node or all incident edges (both outgoing and incoming) for that node"
    description: "Entity access protocols return the relationship neighborhood of an entity - either outgoing relationships, incoming relationships, or both. This enables traversal-based exploration of entity relationship networks."

  - name: "Edge Pattern Queries"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 8:65-78)"
    quote: "Edge patterns - also known as triple patterns in the case of directed, edge-labelled graphs - are singleton graph patterns, i.e., graph patterns with a single edge. Examples of edge patterns are [?ff] type Food Festival or [?ff] location Santiago"
