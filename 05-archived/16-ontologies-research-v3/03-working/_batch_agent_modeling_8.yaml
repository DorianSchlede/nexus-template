patterns:
  - name: "Agent as Key Specification Concept"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:191-192)"
    quote: "Agent: the actor that performs a given process activity. Indeed, it is important to specify who is responsible for the accomplishment of a given activity."
    description: "In BBO ontology, Agent is identified as one of the five main concepts that must be covered for business process representation. The agent modeling approach emphasizes accountability and responsibility - agents are those who perform process activities and are responsible for activity accomplishment. This establishes agents as first-class entities in process ontologies."

  - name: "Human and Software Agent Dichotomy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:346-347)"
    quote: "An Agent may be a HumanResource or a SoftwareResource. The concept Job with the two relations 'subordinated' and 'superior' represent the organizational model of the company"
    description: "BBO models agents with a fundamental type distinction between HumanResource and SoftwareResource. This binary categorization acknowledges that both human and software entities can act as agents performing activities. The organizational hierarchy (subordinated/superior relations via Job) adds structure to human agent relationships, enabling representation of corporate governance and reporting structures."

  - name: "Job-Role Distinction for Agent Authorization"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:350-351)"
    quote: "we differentiated Job from Role to offer more flexibility. Indeed, two persons that have the same Job, may have different authorization levels to execute Activities."
    description: "BBO introduces a nuanced model separating Job (organizational position) from Role (activity authorization). This allows modeling scenarios where agents with identical job titles have different permissions. The distinction enables fine-grained access control and capability modeling for agents, supporting real-world organizational complexity."

  - name: "Direct vs Indirect Agent Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:351-353)"
    quote: "For a given Activity, we may assign a specific Agent (i.e., direct assignment), or a Role (i.e., indirect assignment). In the case of indirect assignment, all agents playing the assigned role are potential performers of the Activity."
    description: "BBO supports two agent assignment patterns: direct (explicit agent instance) and indirect (via role). Direct assignment binds a specific agent to an activity. Indirect assignment creates a pool of potential performers - any agent with the required role can execute the activity. This pattern enables both rigid and flexible workflow assignments."

  - name: "Agent Sub-Ontology Reuse Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:340)"
    quote: "We reused the Agent sub-ontology proposed in (Ruiz et al., 2004)"
    description: "BBO demonstrates ontology reuse by importing an existing Agent sub-ontology from software process management literature. This indicates that agent modeling patterns are transferable across domains (software management to industrial BPM). The reuse pattern validates agent concepts as stable, domain-independent constructs."

  - name: "Resource-Agent Semantic Ambiguity in BPMN"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:290-293)"
    quote: "The Resource concept exists in the BPMN meta-model. However, its semantics and definition are ambiguous. Indeed, on p. 95 of BPMN specification, the Resource class is supposed to cover all resource types. However, the definition of the relation that assigns resources to a process (p. 148) or an activity (p.152), limits the set of resources to the agents responsible for performing the work."
    description: "BBO identifies a fundamental semantic ambiguity in BPMN where 'Resource' oscillates between meaning 'any resource type' and specifically 'agents/performers'. This conflation of agents with generic resources is a common ontological pitfall. BBO resolves this by adopting the broader definition where Resource encompasses all types, while Agent becomes a specific subtype. This clarifies that agents are a specialized form of resource with performer capabilities."

  - name: "Agent-Activity Performance Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:299)"
    quote: "Indeed, in (Awad et al., 2009; Stroppi, Chiotti and Villarreal, 2011) Resource in BPMN is equivalent to Agents."
    description: "Literature review confirms that in BPMN contexts, Resource is often equated with Agent - the entity that performs work. This equivalence pattern appears in multiple BPM works, suggesting a strong conceptual link between resource allocation and agent assignment in process modeling. The performer relationship is central to how agents are conceived in BPM ontologies."

  - name: "Virtual Agent as Process Assistant"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:77-78)"
    quote: "Once populated with BP data, the ontology forms a knowledge base (KB) that will be exploited by a virtual agent to support operators in the execution of BP step-by-step. It will also provide answers to operators' questions about the process execution."
    description: "BBO envisions AI/virtual agents as consumers of the ontology, not just modeled entities within it. The virtual agent uses the populated knowledge base to guide human operators through process execution and answer questions. This represents a meta-level of agent modeling: AI agents that reason over ontologies containing human agent definitions to orchestrate human work."
