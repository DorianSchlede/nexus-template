patterns:
  - name: "Process-FlowElements Composition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:220-224)"
    quote: "Process is a sub-class of FlowElementsContainer. Describing a process consists in defining the FlowElements that compose it."
    description: "Process entities contain FlowElements through composition relationship. This establishes a hierarchical decomposition pattern where processes are defined by their constituent flow elements (activities, events, gateways)."

  - name: "SequenceFlow Transition Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:221-223)"
    quote: "SequenceFlow represents transitions that ensure the move from the source FlowNode to the target one. A SequenceFlow may depend on a given condition"
    description: "SequenceFlow entities connect FlowNodes through source/target relationships. The relationship can be conditional, represented by Expression entities. This defines temporal ordering between activities."

  - name: "FlowNode Specialization Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:223-241)"
    quote: "FlowNode class groups the activities that compose a process: Activity is the work to be performed. Activity class has three sub-classes"
    description: "FlowNode is specialized into Activity, Event, and Gateway. Activity further specializes into Task (atomic), Sub-Process (composite), and CallActivity (reusable). This establishes the core taxonomy for behavioral entities."

  - name: "Activity-LoopCharacteristics Iteration"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:234)"
    quote: "Activity class is related to LoopCharacteristics to represent iteration specifications."
    description: "Activities can have loop characteristics attached to them, enabling representation of iterative/repetitive work patterns. This is a behavioral relationship defining execution semantics."

  - name: "Event-Flow Causation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:236-239)"
    quote: "Event is something that happens during the course of a process. Events affect the flow of the process and usually have a cause or an impact and may require or allow for a reaction."
    description: "Events relate to process flow through causation - they trigger, interrupt, or conclude activities. Events can be interrupting (stopping related activity) or non-interrupting, and are typed (Timer, Conditional, etc.)."

  - name: "Gateway-SequenceFlow Control"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:241)"
    quote: "Gateway is used to control how SequenceFlows interact as they converge or diverge within a Process."
    description: "Gateways have relationships with multiple SequenceFlows, controlling convergence and divergence of process paths. The cardinality of incoming/outgoing relationships defines gateway type (Converging, Diverging, Mixed)."

  - name: "Activity-InputOutputSpecification Association"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:282-286)"
    quote: "an activity may have at most one InputOutputSpecification that is related to the required Input/Output Data...we have added the two relations has_resourceInput and has_resourceOutput"
    description: "Activities relate to InputOutputSpecification entities which in turn connect to Resources through has_resourceInput and has_resourceOutput relationships. This enables specification of what resources an activity consumes and produces."

  - name: "Resource Taxonomy Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:299-303)"
    quote: "In BBO, like in (Karray et al., 2012), we adopt the first definition of Resource, that englobes all resource types. Hence, we may define a resource taxonomy"
    description: "Resource is a superclass with specializations including MaterialResource, HumanResource, SoftwareResource, DataResource, etc. This enables typing resources for competency questions like 'What is the type of a given resource?'"

  - name: "Task-ManufacturingFacility Location"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:309-317)"
    quote: "We limit Task to have at most one ManufacturingFacility, while other types of activities...may require several manufacturing facilities. Indeed, a Task is an atomic unit of work and should be performed at one place."
    description: "Tasks have a constrained relationship (max 1) to ManufacturingFacility, while Processes/SubProcesses can relate to multiple facilities. ManufacturingFacility specializes into Station, Cell, Shop, Factory."

  - name: "WorkProduct-Resource Composition"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:326-331)"
    quote: "we consider WorkProduct as a particular type of MaterialResource...To define the composition of a given product, we added the relation is_composedOf between WorkProduct and Resource"
    description: "WorkProduct is a subclass of MaterialResource and can be composed of other Resources through is_composedOf relationship. Products can become resources for subsequent activities once produced."

  - name: "Agent-Role-Activity Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:340-354)"
    quote: "An Agent may be a HumanResource or a SoftwareResource...For a given Activity, we may assign a specific Agent (i.e., direct assignment), or a Role (i.e., indirect assignment)"
    description: "Agents relate to Activities through either direct assignment (specific agent) or indirect assignment (via Role). This enables flexible resource allocation - all agents playing a role are potential performers."

  - name: "Job Organizational Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:346-351)"
    quote: "The concept Job with the two relations subordinated and superior represent the organizational model of the company...we differentiated Job from Role to offer more flexibility"
    description: "Job entities form hierarchical relationships through subordinated/superior relations, modeling organizational structure. Jobs are distinct from Roles - same Job may have different authorization levels for Activity execution."

  - name: "ConvergingGateway Cardinality Constraint"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:248-252)"
    quote: "A Gateway with a gatewayDirection of converging MUST have multiple incoming Sequence Flows, but MUST NOT have multiple outgoing Sequence Flows"

    description: "StartEvent entities must have at least one outgoing SequenceFlow relationship. This is an existential constraint formalized in OWL - start events initiate process flow."

  - name: "EndEvent-SequenceFlow Target Constraint"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:416)"
    quote: "End Event ends the flow of the Process, and thus, will not have any outgoing Sequence Flows. EndEvent subClassOf not (has_outgoing some SequenceFlow)"
    description: "EndEvent entities cannot have outgoing SequenceFlow relationships - formalized as negation in OWL. End events terminate process flow."

  - name: "ConditionalSequenceFlow-Expression Association"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:443)"
    quote: "Conditional SequenceFlow is a SequenceFlow that has a specified condition Expression. ConditionalSequenceFlow equivalentTo (SequenceFlow and has_conditionExpression some Expression)"
    description: "ConditionalSequenceFlow is defined by having a relationship to at least one Expression entity via has_conditionExpression. This enables conditional routing in process flow."

  - name: "TimerEvent-EventDefinition Typing"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:444)"
    quote: "A Timer Event is an Event that has exactly one TimerEventDefinition. TimerEvent equivalentTo (Event and (has_eventDefinition exactly 1 TimerEventDefinition))"
    description: "Events are typed through their relationship to EventDefinition entities. TimerEvent requires exactly one TimerEventDefinition - cardinality constraint defines event type."

    quote: "List of BPMN elements that MUST NOT be used in an Ad-HocSub-Process: Start Event, End Event. AdHocSubProcess SubClassOf not (has_flowElements some (StartEvent or EndEvent))"
    description: "AdHocSubProcess has negative relationship constraints - cannot contain StartEvent or EndEvent via has_flowElements. This restricts valid composition patterns."
