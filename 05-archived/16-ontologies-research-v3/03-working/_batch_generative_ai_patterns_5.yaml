    quote: "Reflection is a foundational design pattern in agentic workflows, enabling agents to iteratively evaluate and refine their outputs"
    description: "A core agentic pattern where agents incorporate self-feedback mechanisms to identify and address errors, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement. Involves prompting an agent to critique its outputs for correctness, style, and efficiency, then incorporating this feedback into subsequent iterations. External tools like unit tests or web searches can validate results. In multi-agent systems, distinct roles can be assigned where one agent generates outputs while another critiques them."
