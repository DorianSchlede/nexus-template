    quote: "we can treat any derived entity (n1, n2) just like any other entity and infer the df-relationships for (n1, n2), which results in a new path"
    description: "A derived entity is created by reifying a relation between two entities (n1, n2) into a new entity type. This allows inferring directly-follows relationships for the derived entity, describing interactions between the original entities."

  - name: "Df-Relationship Providing New Information"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:15-18)"
    quote: "a df-relationship (e1, e2) provides new information if there is not already an existing df-relationship (e1, e2) in one of the original entities"
    description: "A directly-follows relationship in a derived entity is considered to provide new information only if it describes an actual interaction from one entity to another that was not captured in the original entities' df-paths."

  - name: "Event Node Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:86-91)"
    quote: "Event e is starting or ending event if it has no incoming or outgoing df-relationship at all... Event e is starting or ending event for entity n if it has no incoming or outgoing df-relationship for n"
    description: "Events are defined relative to entities. An event can be starting/ending globally (no df-relationships at all) or for a specific entity (no df-relationships for that entity). Events can serve multiple roles for different entities simultaneously."

  - name: "Intermediate Event Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:106-107)"
    quote: "We call an event intermediate in a df-path of an entity n if it is not a starting or ending event in the df-path of n"
    description: "An intermediate event is positioned within an entity's directly-follows path, having both incoming and outgoing df-relationships for that entity. This contrasts with starting events (no incoming) and ending events (no outgoing)."

  - name: "Local Event vs Shared Event Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:156-158)"
    quote: "An event e is local to an entity n if there is only one df-path of entity n that goes through e... Two or more entities n1,...,nk synchronize in a shared event e"
    description: "Events are classified as local (only one entity's df-path goes through it) or shared (multiple entities' df-paths synchronize at the event). Shared events represent synchronization points between entities."

  - name: "Intermediate Synchronization Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:163-165)"
    quote: "Event e intermediately synchronizes entities n1,...,nk when e is an intermediate event for n1,...,nk. We can interpret an intermediate synchronization as an update or state change"
    description: "Intermediate synchronization occurs when an event is intermediate for multiple entities, representing updates or state changes that require involvement of all synchronized entities."

  - name: "Entity Creation/Initiation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:170-172)"
    quote: "An event e that is intermediate for one entity n but a starting event for entities n1,...,nk can be interpreted as entity n 'created' or 'initiated' entities n1,...,nk"
    description: "Entity creation is identified when an event is intermediate for one entity but marks the start of df-paths for other entities. This pattern indicates one entity spawning or initiating other entities."

  - name: "Entity Completion Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:172-173)"
    quote: "an event e that is intermediate for entity n and ending event for n1,...,nk is 'closing' or 'completing' entities n1,...,nk"
    description: "Entity completion is identified when an event is intermediate for one entity but marks the end of df-paths for other entities. This represents entities being finished or closed by another entity's action."

  - name: "Batching Event Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:174-176)"
    quote: "An event e where multiple entities n1,...,nk of the same type synchronize is a batching event for n1,...,nk"
    description: "A batching event occurs when multiple entities of the same type synchronize in a single event. This represents batch processing where multiple similar items are handled together."

  - name: "Synchronous vs Asynchronous Interaction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:196-200)"
    quote: "An event e where the df-paths of n1 and n2 synchronize is a synchronous interaction. A df-path for entity n describes an asynchronous interaction between n1 and n2 if n synchronizes both with n1 and n2 in different events"
    description: "Entity interactions are classified as synchronous (df-paths meet at same event) or asynchronous (mediated through another entity's df-path across different events). Asynchronous interactions require an intermediary entity."

  - name: "Entity as Message Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:200-202)"
    quote: "If the df-path for n has only 2 events <e1, e2> then we can interpret entity n as message from n1 to n2. We can interpret an event e that is the ending event of entity n1 and the starting event of entity n2 as a handover"
    description: "An entity with a two-event df-path functions as a message between two other entities. A handover is identified when an event simultaneously ends one entity and starts another, representing transfer of control or work."

  - name: "Indirect Entity Interaction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:212-215)"
    quote: "n1 and n2 interact indirectly if for any two events e1 of n1 and e2 of n2 the shortest df-path from e1 to e2 involves df-relationships from multiple other entities"
    description: "Indirect interaction occurs when two entities are connected only through df-paths that traverse multiple other entities. This contrasts with direct synchronous interaction at shared events."

  - name: "Resource/Actor Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:416-418)"
    quote: "the organizational entities that actually make the process happen: the workers and supporting systems often called resources, and the work itself that is being carried out"
    description: "Resources or Actors are organizational entities representing the workers and systems that execute process activities. They are distinct from the entities being processed (objects/items) and are responsible for performing the actual work."

  - name: "Activity as Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:485-487)"
    quote: "if we pick the Activity property as 'entity identifier', we infer entities such as Receive SO, Unpack, Scan, Store, Retrieve, Pack Shipment. These are not entities handled by the process. No, these entities are the actual building blocks of the process"
    description: "Activities can be treated as entities by using the Activity property as an identifier. This creates abstract work stations that other entities 'pass through', enabling analysis of queues and workflow patterns."

  - name: "Queue Definition via Activity Entities"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:513-514)"
    quote: "The space between two work stations A and B is a queue A:B, i.e., the space where Items after being worked on at A wait until being worked on at B"
    description: "A queue is defined as the space between two activity entities (work stations) where items wait. This emerges from treating activities as entities and analyzing how other entities traverse between them."

  - name: "Task Instance Definition"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:621-625)"
    quote: "A task instance of an actor R working on an entity X materializes in an event knowledge graph as a specific subgraph over event nodes e1,...,ek: (1) the df-paths of R and X both meet in e1, (2) diverge in ek, (3) synchronize in each event node"
    description: "A task instance is a formal subgraph pattern representing a unit of work: an actor's df-path meets an entity's df-path at a start event, they synchronize through consecutive events, and diverge at an end event. This captures the actor performing related activities on an entity."

  - name: "Entity Node vs Event Node Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:820-823)"
    quote: "Explicitly represent every entity that an event is correlated to as a node. An entity thereby can be anything: a specific object, a person or actor, or even an abstract concept such as an activity"
    description: "Entities are represented as distinct nodes from events in event knowledge graphs. Entities can represent concrete objects, people/actors, or abstract concepts. This dual-node structure separates what exists from what happens."

  - name: "Class Node vs Entity Node Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:496-500)"
    quote: "Entity nodes identified by the activity property are semantically different from the Class nodes identified by the activity property... Class nodes semantically aggregate the existing df relationships between events"
    description: "Class nodes aggregate df-relationships between events of other entities into relationships between classes (for process discovery). Entity nodes of type Activity derive new df-relationships describing how entities pass through activities. Same identifier, different semantic purposes."

  - name: "TaskInstance Node Type"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:702-715)"
    quote: "For each task instances... we extend the graph with a new node with label TaskInstance... We add a new contains relationship (ti, e) from each TaskInstance node ti to each Event node e that is part of the task instance"
    description: "TaskInstance is a node type that aggregates event nodes into units of work. It has a contains relationship to constituent events and inherits a Task property derived from the sequence of activity values in its events."

  - name: "Proclet Definition for Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:17-23)"
    quote: "Object-centric Petri nets also first discover one Petri net per entity type, then annotate the places and arcs with entity identifiers, and then compose all entity nets along transitions for the same activity"
    description: "In object-centric Petri nets, each entity type gets its own Petri net model describing its behavior. These are composed by connecting transitions representing the same activity across entity types, enabling modeling of entity interactions."

  # ============================================================

  - name: "Event Definition in Event Logs"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:32-34)"
    quote: "events in an event log, which can be considered as the observations (rows) in our dataset, are related to each other in terms of time and by means of an overarching case dimension"
    description: "Events are the fundamental observation units in process mining. Unlike independent observations in classical data science, events are temporally ordered and grouped by case, requiring specialized analysis techniques that account for these relationships."

  - name: "Case/Process Instance Definition"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:68-74)"
    quote: "each event should be linked to a case or process instance, typically by using a Case ID. This is 'Requirement 1'. In the simple example, each case or process instance will refer to one procurement"
    description: "A case (or process instance) is the grouping unit for events, representing one complete execution of a business process. Each case has a unique Case ID that links all events belonging to that execution together."

  - name: "Activity Definition (Requirement 2)"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:92-101)"
    quote: "each event should correspond to an activity executed within the process. More specifically, an assumption is made that there exists a restricted set of labels, reflecting the activities in the business process"
    description: "An Activity is a labeled step in a business process that each event maps to. Activities come from a restricted vocabulary of process steps that are typically understandable to business experts. This is the second essential requirement for event logs."

  - name: "Event Ordering via Timestamp (Requirement 3)"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:110-116)"
    quote: "each case logically consists of a sequence of events. Most often, this ordering will be derived from a timestamp attribute. However, this is not strictly mandatory"
    description: "Events within a case form a sequence determined by temporal ordering. While timestamps are the typical mechanism for ordering, any consistent ordering method is acceptable. This sequencing is the third essential requirement for event logs."

  - name: "Trace Definition"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:169-170)"
    quote: "IEEE XES specifies the concept of a log, a trace, and an attribute component. Event and/or trace classifiers are used to assign an identity to traces and events"
    description: "A trace is a sequence of events belonging to a single case/process instance. Traces are grouped into logs. Classifiers define how events and traces are identified, enabling consistent event log structure."

  - name: "Event Types/Lifecycle Transitions"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:181-186)"
    quote: "the concept of event types or lifecycle transitions of activities. When sourcing events from many process-aware information systems, events oftentimes relate to the transactional lifecycle that activities undergo"
    description: "Events can represent different lifecycle states of activities (e.g., started, completed, suspended). A transactional lifecycle model describes the valid states and transitions an activity may undergo during execution."

  - name: "Event vs Activity Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:219-224)"
    quote: "In case there are no defined event types, one typically assumes that an event pertaining to the execution of an activity reflects the completion of the activity. In this case, every activity execution is represented by a single event"
    description: "Events are atomic occurrences while activities may span durations. When lifecycle transitions are unavailable, each event represents activity completion. For performance analysis, start and completion events are needed to distinguish waiting time from execution time."

  - name: "Event Log Data Source Types"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:262-322)"
    quote: "At system level, we identify the following categorization of most common and important sources for event data: BPMS, Case management and ticketing systems, ERP/CRM, Operational databases, Project management software..."
    description: "Event logs can be sourced from various system types including BPMS, case management systems, ERP/CRM, operational databases, project management software, data warehouses/lakes, web data, and IoT systems. Each has different levels of process-awareness and data readiness."

  - name: "Object/Artifact Entity in Event Logs"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:424-433)"
    quote: "Many source systems, including popular ERP systems, store data at the logical level of objects instead of providing a true process perspective... The recently introduced OCEL standard is another relevant piece of work, putting forward a general standard to interchange object-centric event data"
    description: "Objects or artifacts are entities that events can relate to in object-centric process mining. Unlike traditional case-based views, object-centric event logs allow events to correlate with multiple objects of different types, captured in the OCEL standard."

  - name: "Event Correlation Definition"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:453-459)"
    quote: "Mapping event data extracted from source systems and databases to cases (instances of the business process under investigation) is denoted as correlation"
    description: "Event correlation is the process of assigning Case IDs to events when they are not readily available in source data. This can be done using event attributes, conceptual models, or process models to infer which events belong together."

  - name: "Event Abstraction Definition"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:476-481)"
    quote: "abstraction techniques can be considered as mapping techniques that can translate one or more lower-level events into higher-level events pertaining to business process activities"
    description: "Event abstraction transforms fine-grained events into coarser-grained events at the business activity level. This involves aggregating multiple low-level events (e.g., sensor readings) into meaningful process activities that business experts can interpret."

  - name: "Resource Entity Definition"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:148-152)"
    quote: "the availability of additional data attributes, especially information on resources, costs, etc. opens up possibilities for the application of process mining techniques that go beyond process discovery... organizational mining techniques were developed to focus on resources"
    description: "Resources are entities (people, systems) that execute activities in a process. Resource information in event logs enables organizational mining to analyze how workers and systems collaborate, their workload, and performance patterns."
