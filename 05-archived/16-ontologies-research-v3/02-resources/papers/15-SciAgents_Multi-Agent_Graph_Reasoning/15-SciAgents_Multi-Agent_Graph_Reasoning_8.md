**Research Proposal: Investigating the Role of Hierarchical Structures in Enhancing Superhydrophobicity and Mechanical Properties of**
**Biomaterials**


**1- Hypothesis:**


The hypothesis of this research is that the hierarchical structure of biomaterials, specifically nacre, significantly enhances both their superhydrophobic properties and mechanical robustness.
By mimicking the hexagonally packed arrangement of platelets found in nacre and incorporating amyloid fibrils, we can develop advanced self-cleaning coatings with superior mechanical
properties.


**2- Outcome:**


We expect to develop a novel biomimetic material that exhibits: - Superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle greater than 150 degrees. - Enhanced mechanical properties, including a
fracture toughness of at least 10 MPaÂ·m^0.5. - Self-cleaning capabilities, demonstrated by the ability to repel water and dirt effectively. - Detailed AFM images showing the nanoscale
hierarchical structure of the material.


**3- Mechanisms:**


The anticipated mechanisms include: - **Hexagonally Packed Platelets** : The hexagonal packing of platelets will create a hierarchical structure that enhances both mechanical strength and
superhydrophobicity. - **Amyloid Fibrils** : Incorporating amyloid fibrils will contribute to the hierarchical structure, providing additional mechanical reinforcement and influencing surface
properties. - **Energy Absorption** : The hierarchical structure will absorb destructive energy during fracture, preventing catastrophic failure and enhancing toughness. - **Surface Texture** : The
hierarchical arrangement will create a rough surface texture that contributes to superhydrophobicity by minimizing the contact area between water droplets and the surface.


**4- Design Principles:**


**Biomimicry** : Mimic the hexagonally packed arrangement of platelets found in nacre.
**Multiscale Analysis** : Conduct multiscale analysis to optimize the hierarchical structure at both the micro and nanoscale levels.
**Material Selection** : Use materials that can form amyloid fibrils and platelets, such as specific proteins and polymers.
**Surface Engineering** : Engineer the surface texture to enhance superhydrophobicity, ensuring a water contact angle greater than 150 degrees.
**Mechanical Testing** : Perform mechanical testing to measure properties such as fracture toughness and elasticity.


**5- Unexpected Properties:**


**Enhanced Durability** : The combination of hierarchical structure and amyloid fibrils may result in unexpected durability, with the material maintaining its properties under extreme
conditions.
**Self-Healing** : The hierarchical structure might enable self-healing properties, where minor damages are repaired autonomously.
**Thermal Stability** : The material may exhibit unexpected thermal stability due to the robust hierarchical arrangement.


**6- Comparison:**


**Traditional Coatings** : Compared to traditional self-cleaning coatings, the proposed material will have superior mechanical properties and durability.
**Natural Nacre** : While natural nacre is limited to biological environments, the biomimetic material can be engineered for a wide range of applications.
**Existing Superhydrophobic Materials** : Current superhydrophobic materials often lack mechanical robustness; our material aims to combine both properties effectively.


**7- Novelty:**


**Integration of Amyloid Fibrils** : The use of amyloid fibrils in creating a hierarchical structure is novel and has not been extensively explored.
**Multiscale Optimization** : The focus on optimizing the hierarchical structure at multiple scales is a novel approach to enhancing both superhydrophobicity and mechanical properties.

**Expanded Hypothesis**


The hypothesis of this research is that the hierarchical structure of biomaterials, specifically nacre, significantly enhances both their superhydrophobic properties and mechanical robustness.
By mimicking the hexagonally packed arrangement of platelets found in nacre and incorporating amyloid fibrils, we can develop advanced self-cleaning coatings with superior mechanical

**Detailed Expansion:**


1. **Hierarchical Structure and Mechanical Properties** :


**Nacre's Structure** : Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is composed of aragonite platelets (CaCOâ‚ƒ) arranged in a brick-and-mortar structure, with organic matrix layers in between.
This hierarchical structure provides nacre with exceptional toughness and strength.
**Hypothesis Specifics** : We hypothesize that replicating this hierarchical structure using synthetic materials will result in a composite material with enhanced mechanical
properties. Specifically, we aim to achieve a fracture toughness of at least 10 MPaÂ·m^0.5, which is comparable to or better than natural nacre.


2. **Superhydrophobicity** :


**Surface Texture** : The hierarchical structure of nacre contributes to its surface roughness, which can be leveraged to create superhydrophobic surfaces. Superhydrophobicity is
characterized by a water contact angle greater than 150 degrees.
**Hypothesis Specifics** : By engineering the surface texture of the biomimetic material to mimic the hierarchical structure of nacre, we hypothesize that we can achieve
superhydrophobicity. This will be quantified by measuring the water contact angle and ensuring it exceeds 150 degrees.


3. **Role of Amyloid Fibrils** :


**Amyloid Fibrils** : These protein aggregates form fibrous structures that can enhance the mechanical properties of materials. They are known for their strength and stability.
**Hypothesis Specifics** : Incorporating amyloid fibrils into the hierarchical structure is hypothesized to provide additional mechanical reinforcement and influence the surface
properties, contributing to both the mechanical robustness and superhydrophobicity of the material.


4. **Energy Absorption** :


**Destructive Energy** : The hierarchical structure of nacre allows it to absorb destructive energy during fracture, preventing catastrophic failure.
**Hypothesis Specifics** : We hypothesize that the biomimetic material will exhibit similar energy absorption capabilities, enhancing its toughness and durability. This will be
tested by subjecting the material to mechanical stress and measuring its fracture toughness and energy absorption.


5. **AFM Imaging** :


**Nanoscale Analysis** : Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows for the measurement of mechanical properties at the nanoscale level and provides detailed images of the
hierarchical structure.
**Hypothesis Specifics** : We hypothesize that AFM imaging will reveal a well-defined hierarchical structure in the biomimetic material, similar to that of natural nacre. This will
be used to correlate the observed structure with the measured mechanical and superhydrophobic properties.
