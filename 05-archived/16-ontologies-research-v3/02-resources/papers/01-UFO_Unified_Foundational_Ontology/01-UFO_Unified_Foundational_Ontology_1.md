Abstract: The Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) was developed over the last two decades by consistently putting together
theories from areas such as formal ontology in philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical logics. It comprises
a number of micro-theories addressing fundamental conceptual modeling notions, including entity types and relationship types.
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current state of UFO, presenting a formalization of the ontology, along with the analysis
of a number of cases to illustrate the application of UFO and facilitate its comparison with other foundational ontologies in this
special issue. (The cases originate from the First FOUST Workshop – the Foundational Stance, an international forum dedicated
to Foundational Ontology research.)


Keywords: UFO, OntoUML, foundational ontology, ontological analysis, formal ontology


**Introduction**


For almost two decades now, the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) has been the focus of a long-term
research program on ontological foundations for conceptual modeling. UFO (Guizzardi, 2005; Guizzardi
et al., 2015b) was developed by consistently putting together theories from formal ontology in philosophy,
cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical logic. UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses
fundamental conceptual modeling notions via a set of micro-theories, including:


**–** a theory of _types and taxonomic structures_ (Guizzardi and Wagner, 2004a; Guizzardi et al., 2021)
that is connected to a theory of _object identifier_ s, including a formal semantics in a sortal quantified
modal logic (Guizzardi, 2015);

**–** a theory of _part-whole relations_ (Guizzardi, 2007, 2009, 2011; Guizzardi et al., 2016);

**–** a theory of _particularized intrinsic properties, attributes and attribute value spaces_ (Guizzardi et al.,
2006; Guizzardi and Zamborlini, 2014), which includes a view on datatypes as semantic reference
structures (Albuquerque and Guizzardi, 2013);

**–** a theory of _particularized relational properties and relations_, (Guarino and Guizzardi, 2015, 2016;
Guizzardi and Wagner, 2008; Fonseca et al., 2019), including a proposal for _Weak Truthmaking_
(Guarino et al., 2019) connecting particularized properties to propositions;

**–** a theory of _roles_ (Guizzardi, 2005, 2006; Masolo et al., 2005);

**–** a theory of _events_ (Guizzardi et al., 2013a; Almeida et al., 2019; Benevides et al., 2019b; Guarino
and Guizzardi, 2016; Benevides et al., 2019a; Guizzardi et al., 2016), including aspects such as
event mereology, temporal ordering of events, object participation in events, causation, change, and
the connection between events and endurants via dispositions;

**–** a theory for _multi-level modeling_ (Carvalho et al., 2017, 2016; Guizzardi et al., 2015a; Fonseca
et al., 2021a).

2 _Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_


This program was initially inspired by seminal work on ontological foundations for conceptual modeling (Wand and Weber, 1989, 1990; Weber, 1997) that had employed the work of physicist and philosopher of science Mario Bunge (Bunge, 1977) to evaluate a number of conceptual modeling languages, including NIAM (Weber and Zhang, 1991), ER (Wand et al., 1999), UML (Evermann and Wand, 2001),
and OWL (Bera and Wand, 2004). Despite the fruitfulness of the application of Bunge’s work to conceptual modeling, it soon became clear that there was a mismatch between the purposes for which Bunge’s
ontology was developed and the requirements of ontological foundations for conceptual modeling. This
became manifest in the literature as the predictions made by the Bunge Wand Weber (BWW) approach
found themselves in strong contrast with the intuitions and practical knowledge of modelers, as well as
with some predictions unanimously shared by alternative approaches (Guizzardi et al., 2015b). For example, BWW disavowed reified relationships, a position that conflicted with modeling predictions made by
other foundational theories, such as Jackendoff’s semantic structures (Veres and Hitchman, 2002; Veres
and Mansson, 2005), and with evidence from practitioners (Hitchman, 2003).
It was clear from the outset that an ontological theory for conceptual modeling would have to countenance both individuals and types, accounting for not only substantials and their types but also accidents
and their types (e.g. particularized properties, moments, qualities, modes, tropes, abstract particulars, aspects, ways). In other words, a four-category ontology (Lowe and Lowe, 2006) was required. We needed
particularized properties not only because they were of great importance in making sense of language and
cognition (Parsons, 1990; Masolo et al., 2003; Davidson, 2001, Ch. 6), but because they would repeatedly appear in the discourse of conceptual modelers. Moreover, particularized relations (relationships) and
particularized intrinsic properties (e.g., often represented by the so-called weak entities) are frequently
modeled as bearers of other particularized properties in the practice of conceptual modeling. In fact, as
demonstrated by Guizzardi and colleagues (see Guizzardi, 2005; Guizzardi et al., 2006; Guizzardi and
Wagner, 2008; Guarino and Guizzardi, 2015), many conceptual modeling problems can hardly be solved
without considering particularized properties.
In initial papers for this project, Guizzardi and Wagner attempted to employ the General Formal Ontology (GFO) and the General Ontology Language (GOL) being developed in Leipzig, Germany, as a
reference theory (Heller and Herre, 2004; Herre et al., 2004). More or less at the same time, a strong cooperation was established between them and the Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA – Trento, Italy),
which was concurrently developing the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering
(DOLCE; Masolo et al., 2003). In this setting, their first attempt was to unify DOLCE and GFO to produce a reference foundational ontology for conceptual modeling, hence the name Unified Foundational
Ontology (Guizzardi and Wagner, 2004b). Both theories were philosophically sound, formally characterized, and based on the so-called Aristotelian Square, i.e., they were “four-category ontologies” (Lowe and
Lowe, 2006).
UFO has since evolved, always focused on the requirements of the conceptual modeling discipline. In
particular, ontological foundations for conceptual modeling would demand micro-theories to address its
most fundamental constructs, namely, entity types and relationship types [1] . So, any reference theory for
conceptual modeling would need a rich theory of entity (object) types and a rich theory of domain (also
called material) relations. In the case of the former, we needed something in the spirit of the ontology
of universals underlying the OntoClean methodology (Guarino and Welty, 2009) in order to systematize
a number of notions that were pervasive in the conceptual modeling literature (e.g., types, roles, phases
or states, mixins) but for which there were no precise definitions or consensus (Guizzardi et al., 2004).
In that respect, GFO’s theory of universals still does not recognize these notions and DOLCE does not
include universal as a category (DOLCE was designed as an ontology of particulars). Regarding the latter,
DOLCE still does not include a theory of particularized relational properties (relational qualities) and
the GFO theory of relations is subject to the so-called Bradley’s Regress (Bradley, 1893) and, hence, it
can only be instantiated by infinite (logical) models. This feature renders it ill-suited for most conceptual


1Hence, the name of the so-called Entity-Relationship approach that gives the name to the most important conference in
conceptual modeling!

modeling applications. Finally, there were many additional specific aspects needed for a general ontology
for conceptual modeling that were not addressed by the existing approaches (e.g., attributes and datatypes,
a rich theory of cognitively/linguistically motivated part-whole relations, higher-order types).
UFO’s evolution has also been influenced by its applications over the years. It has been employed as
a basis for analyzing, reengineering, and integrating many modeling languages and standards in different
domains (e.g., UML, BPMN, ArchiMate), as well as for the development of core and domain ontologies in
different areas. For instance, it has been successfully used to provide conceptual clarification in complex
domains such as risk (Sales et al., 2018b), services (Nardi et al., 2015), trust (Amaral et al., 2019), law
(Griffo et al., 2015), biodiversity (Albuquerque et al., 2015), design science research (Weigand et al.,
2021), among many others (a more comprehensive list is provided in Section 4).
Of all UFO’s applications, one deserves special attention, namely, the use of UFO in the design of an
ontology-driven conceptual modeling language, which later came to be known as OntoUML (Guizzardi,
2005). This is a language that reflects the ontological micro-theories comprising UFO. The observation
of the application of OntoUML over the years conducted by several groups in a variety of domains also
amounted to a fruitful empirical source of knowledge regarding the language and its foundations [2] . In this
paper, we incorporate the latest developments of UFO arising out of these observations (Guizzardi et al.,
2021). More specifically, the fine-grained distinctions among types (differentiating types according to
meta-types such as _Kinds_, _Phases_, _Roles_ and _Mixins_ ) that were before only applied to substantials are now
applied to endurants in general (including thus _existentially dependent_ endurants such as: _qualities_, e.g.,
the perceived value of the experience, the color of the apple; _modes_, e.g., Paul’s Dengue Fever, Matteo’s
capacity of programming in Scratch; and _relators_, e.g., John and Mary’s Marriage, Giovanni’s Employment at the UN). These were needed to capture subtle aspects of domains such as value, service, economic
exchange, and many others (Blums and Weigand, 2017; Carmo et al., 2017; Guarino and Guizzardi, 2015;
Zamborlini et al., 2017), and are also employed in some cases presented in this paper.
This paper can be consumed as an introduction to UFO, as we cover its main tenets (Section 1), its
formalization (Section 2), its application to relevant illustrative domains (Section 3), and its relevance
in the field of applied ontology and conceptual modeling (Section 4). Alternatively, readers interested in
comparing UFO’s modeling approach with those of other foundational ontologies in this special issue may
proceed directly to Section 3. As these examples are mainly represented by means of OntoUML models
and all axioms in the paper are preceded by descriptions in natural language, the axioms can be largely
skipped, with Section 2 serving as a reference of the axiomatization following the examples for those
concerned with a more precise representation of UFO’s approach.


**1. Principles and structure of UFO**


The objective of UFO was, from the beginning, to provide foundations for domain analysis in conceptual modeling, as well as for designing concrete models and modeling grammars. The idea was to develop
a “Calculus of Content” aimed at supporting the ontological analysis, conceptual clarification, and semantic explicitation of the content embedded in representation artifacts. These, in turn, should support human
users in tasks such as domain understanding, problem-solving, and meaning negotiation (Guarino et al.,
2020; Proper and Guizzardi, 2020; Guizzardi et al., 2007; Guizzardi, 2020).
As defended by the philosopher Kit Fine, _“[...] the fundamental question of ontology is not ‘what is_
_there?’ but ‘what is real?’[...] As a first stab, [...] what is real is what one must make reference to in_
_giving a description of reality.”_ [3] . In this spirit, UFO aims at providing instruments for describing what is
real, at the mesoscopic level, and as accounted for by human cognition. For this reason, not only rocks
and animals are real, but so are enrollments, employments, presidential mandates, symptoms, covalent
bonds, birthday parties and football matches, colors and electrical charges, organizations and constitutions,
software systems and derivative contracts.

4 _Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_


Given these objectives, UFO was constructed as a _descriptive_ (as opposed to a _revisionary_ ) project
(Strawson, 1959). This means that it is an ontology that takes into full consideration both cognitive and
linguistic aspects informing its constituting categories. However, this is far from saying that reality is
purely cognitively constructed. In this sense and, as put by Smith (2019), _“[t]his is not to say that onto-_
_logical items or entities—objects, properties, states of affairs, etc.—are ways of taking the world. Tables,_
_detente, machinists, and love affairs are absolutely not merely epistemic entities... In that sense, [this view]_
_is stubbornly realist: all these entities are things beyond us, things in the world. [They] are not ‘ways_
_of taking the world’, They are the world taken a certain way.”_ . From considering that “the world can be
taken in many ways” (i.e., a pluralism of worldviews), it does not follow that anything goes, i.e., that
all worldviews are equally valid or even acceptable. We should still “carve reality at its joints”, “joints”
that are supplied by concrete causal nexus of properties associated with natural and nominal kinds (Keil,
1992). There are, however, multiple ontologically viable and cognitively useful ways of doing that. The ultimate goal of this project is, thus, providing well-founded engineering mechanisms for helping modelers
to achieve _intra-worldview consistency_, i.e., ontological consistency when taking the world a certain way,
and _inter-worldview interoperability_, i.e., making explicit the ontological commitments of a worldview
such that different worldviews can safely interoperate (Guizzardi, 2014).
UFO is organized in three main fragments:


**– UFO-A**, which is an ontology of endurants;

**– UFO-B**, which is an ontology of perdurants (Benevides et al., 2019b);

**– UFO-C**, which is an ontology of social and intentional entities build on the foundations provided by
the other two (Guizzardi et al., 2008; de Oliveira Bringuente et al., 2011; Guizzardi and Guizzardi,
2011).


In this paper, we focus on the categories around UFO-A and a few categories of UFO-B, which are
depicted in Figure 1. UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between _en-_
_durants_ (e.g., Mick Jagger, the Moon, John’s headache, Mary’s marriage to Paul) and _perdurants_ (e.g., the
2020 U.S. presidential election, the World War II, the UEFA Euro 2021 Final), as opposed to a 4D ontology in which all concrete individuals are perdurants. Endurants are individuals that exist in time with all
their parts. They have essential and accidental properties and, hence, they can qualitatively change while
maintaining their numerical identity (i.e., while remaining the same individual). The sorts of changes an
endurant can undergo while maintaining its identity is defined by the unique _Kind_ it instantiates.
Perdurants [4] are individuals that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts. They are manifestations of
dispositions and only exist in the past. As such, perdurants are _modally fragile_, i.e., there is no cross-world
identity between them and, hence, they cannot be in any way different than what they are (Guizzardi et al.,
2016). Changes are perdurants but perdurants cannot be the subject of change. Any apparent change to a
perdurant is either a variation (i.e., different temporal parts of an event having incompatible properties),
or a change happening to some underlying endurant that is the focus of that event (Guizzardi et al., 2016;
Guarino and Guizzardi, 2016). An endurant then _participates in_ a perdurant if that perdurant has a part
that is a _manifestation of_ a _disposition inhering in_ that endurant (Benevides et al., 2019b).
Regarding the endurant fragment of the ontology, UFO is an ontology based of the so-called _Aristotelian_
_Square_, thus, accounting for both substantial individuals (or _Substantials_ ), i.e., _independent entities_ (e.g.,
Mick Jagger, the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano), as well as particularized properties, i.e., _existen-_
_tially dependent entities_ or _moments_, these last ones termed aspects, abstract particulars, or variable tropes
(Moltmann, 2020). Moments are parasitic entities and can only exist by _inhering in_ other entities.
_Intrinsic moments_ are existentially dependent on a single individual. These include _qualities_, i.e., reifications of categorical properties such as color, height, weight, electrical charge. Qualities are entities
that can be directly projected into certain value spaces. The latter, termed _quality structures_, are abstract
entities delimiting the space of possible values (qualia, singular _quale_ ) for qualities of a given quality
type. Quality structures can be either one-dimensional, in which case they are termed _quality dimensions_,


4We often refer to perdurants as events, given that the latter is more easily understood by a non-philosophical audience.

or composed of multiple co-dependent dimensions (see also integral dimensions, Gärdenfors, 2004), in
which case they are termed _quality domains_ . While the former includes height and weight dimensions as
examples (structures isomorphic to a subset of the positive half-line of real numbers), the later includes as
examples the color spindle and the taste tetrahedron.
Intrinsic moments also include _modes_ . Modes can bear their own moments, including their own qualities, which can vary in independent ways. The category of modes include _dispositions_ (e.g., functions,
capabilities, capacities, vulnerabilities, etc.) as well as externally dependent entities (e.g., the love of John
for Mary, the commitment of Paul towards Clara to meet for lunch next Friday). _Externally dependent_
_modes_ inhere in an entity while being _externally dependent_ on another entity [5] . A particularly interesting
type of externally dependent mode is a _qua individual_, which is a mode composed of other externally
dependent modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and the same _foun-_
_dational event_ (Guizzardi, 2006). For instance, the sum of all commitments and claims of John towards
Mary form such a complex mode that we could call John-qua-husband-of-Mary, as they all inhere in John,
are externally dependent of Mary, and are founded in that particular wedding event. Likewise, a _relator_ is
a moment (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is an aggregation of qua individuals (Guizzardi and
Wagner, 2008). For instance, John and Mary’s Marriage is composed of John-qua-husband-of-Mary and
Mary-qua-wife-of-John. A relator is, hence, existentially dependent on multiple individuals, namely, the
bearers of its constituting qua individuals. Examples of relators include marriages, enrollments, employments, contracts, and presidential mandates. Externally dependent modes as well as relators serve as truthmarkers of material relations (Guarino and Guizzardi, 2015; Guarino et al., 2019), the first for one-sided
relations and the second for double-sided (or multi-sided) ones (Fonseca et al., 2019).


5That is, it is existentially dependent on an entity mereologically disjoint from the entity it inheres in (aka its bearer).


6 _Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_


Both substantials and moments are full-fledged endurants, being both able to bear moments, i.e., including cases involving moments of moments (e.g., the intensity of my headache, the hue of the color).
All endurants can have essential and accidental properties and can qualitatively change while maintaining
their identity, provided they respect the principle of application provided by their respective Kinds. For
example, John and Mary’s marriage can change from a marriage with full separation of assets to one with
partial separation of assets. The way their marriage can change is defined by the Kind it instantiates (marriage). Additionally, all endurants can have parts (e.g., George’s employment to the UN is composed of a
number of mutual claims and obligations).
Mereologically complex substantials are characterized by the different unity conditions that bind their
parts together:


**–** _Quantities_ are maximally-topologically-self-connected (e.g., pieces) of homeomerous amounts of
matter (Guizzardi, 2010), e.g., that puddle of water, this particular pile of sand;

**–** _Collectives_ are entities whose parts play the same role with respect to the whole (Guizzardi, 2011),
e.g., the Black Forest (as a collective of trees), a deck of cards, the Dutch-speaking group in the
crowd; and

**–** _Objects_ (aka _functional complexes_ ) are entities whose parts play differentiated functional roles with
respect to the whole (Guizzardi, 2009), e.g, a human body, an organization, a computer, John’s car.

UFO is an ontology of both particulars and universals (or types), i.e., patterns of features that are repeatable across different particulars. In fact, UFO is an ontology that also countenances high-order types,
i.e., types whose instances are also types. The hierarchy of types in UFO reflects on the one hand the
existing distinctions among sorts of individuals. So, we have perdurant types, substantial types, moment
types, etc. On the other hand, UFO employs a number of formal meta-properties to spawn a rich typology
of endurant types (Guizzardi et al., 2021).
As previously mentioned, a fundamental sort of endurant type is a _kind_, which provides uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances. For example, the types person, dog, computer, car, headache, organization and marriage are typically considered to be kinds. Kinds apply to instantiating individuals in all possible situations in which these individuals exist, and hence kinds are _rigid_
types, applying necessarily to their instances. A _sortal_ is either a kind or a specialization of a kind, and
every sortal that is not a kind specializes exactly one kind. These specializations can be either themselves
rigid, in which case they are termed _subkinds_ (e.g., hatchback car as a subkind of car; financial organization
as a subkind of organization) or they can be _anti-rigid_, i.e., classifying only contingently their instances.
Among the latter, we have sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic, termed _Phases_
(e.g., teenager as a phase of person, hemorrhagic dengue fever as a phase of dengue fever, and tenured
employment as a phase of employment), and we have sortals whose contingent classification conditions
are relational, termed _roles_ (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator,
and husband as a role of a person in the scope of a marriage relator).
In contrast with sortals, non-sortals are types that represent common properties of individuals of multiple Kinds. These can be:


**–** _categories_ : rigid types that define essential properties for their instances, e.g., the category ‘physical
object’ describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension, common to things of the
kinds car, person, bridge, cow, etc.;

**–** _phase mixins_ : anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation
is characterized by _intrinsic contingent conditions_ . For example, the phase mixin ‘living animal’
may apply to instances of the kinds person, dog, and horse; the phase mixin ‘functional device’ may
characterize instances of the kinds computer, watch, and espresso machine;

**–** _role mixins_ : anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation
is characterized by _relational contingent conditions_ . Examples include ‘customer’ for the kinds
person and organization, but also ‘insured legal relator’ for the kinds employment and enrollment;

**–** _mixins_ : semi-rigid types that define properties that are essential to some of their instances but accidental to some other instances (e.g., being a ‘music artist’ is essential to bands but accidental to
people).

_1.1. Summary_


For the sake of comparison with other foundational ontologies within this special issue, we summarize
UFO’s core positions in the list below:


I. UFO distinguishes between endurants and perdurants. Endurants are individuals that exist in time
with all their parts. Perdurants are individuals that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts. An
endurant can change while maintaining its identity, a perdurant cannot.
II. UFO accounts for the existence of both independent and dependent endurants. Independent endurants are called substantials, while those that existentially depend on other individuals are dubbed
moments. More precisely, a moment is said to inhere in another endurant. Perdurants are always
dependent on the substantials that participate in them.
III. Perdurants are past entities in UFO and cannot genuinely change. Alleged change in a perdurant is
thus either a reflection of a perdurant having temporal parts with different properties, or, a change in
an endurant (e.g., a mode or relator) of which the event is a manifestation. Thus, instead of admitting
those entities that Stout refers to as “processes” (Stout, 1997), we rather consider those underlying
endurants as the subject of change, and track their manifestations in time.
IV. UFO accounts for (particularized) intrinsic and relational properties, which can serve as truthmakers for different types of relations and attributes. Particularized intrinsic properties that can be
projected into a value space are deemed qualities, whilst those that cannot are deemed modes. Particularized relational properties are called relators. The term quantity is reserved for substantials
that are maximally-topologically-self-connected of homeomerous amounts of matter.
V. In UFO, roles are anti-rigid types whose instantiation occur in virtue of relational conditions. Roles
that can be instantiated by individuals of a single kinds are simply termed roles, while those that
can be instantiated by individuals of different kinds (thus, adhering to different identity principles)
are termed roleMixins. There is no explicit definition of function in UFO.


**2. The formalization of UFO in First-Order Modal Logic**


In this section, we present a first-order modal theory of endurant types, in which types and their instances are both in the domain of quantification (i.e., first-order citizens), being connected by the instantiation relation (symbolized as “::”). For our purposes, the first-order modal logic QS5 plus the Barcan
formula and its converse suffices (Fitting and Mendelsohn, 2012). That means that we assume a _fixed_
domain of entities for every possible world, what is traditionally associated to a _possibilistic_ view of the
entities of the domain, i.e., the domain includes all the _possibilia_ . The modal operators of _necessity_ ( _2_ )
and _possibility_ ( _3_ ) are used with their usual meaning.
We drop both the universal quantifier and the necessity operator in case their scope takes the full for
_def_
mula. Definitions, introduced by “ = ”, “are to be viewed as extraneous conventions of notational abbreviation” (Quine, 1937, p. 72). Axioms, theorems and definitions are indexed as in “(a _n_ )”, “(t _n_ )” and “(d _n_ ),”
respectively. In a few cases when it is necessary to refer to the original formalization of UFO, we use
“( _m.n_ )” to denote the _n_ th axiom of the _m_ th chapter of Guizzardi (2005). Finally, this section is based on
a first-order logic formalization of UFO [6] specified in the TPTP syntax (Sutcliffe, 2017), and submitted to
multiple automated provers for consistency and satisfability checks.

_2.1. Types, individuals and instantiation_


Firstly, _types_ are implicitly defined as those entities that are possibly instantiated (a1), while _individuals_
are those necessarily not instantiated (a2). The domain of :: is Type _∪_ Individual (a3) and it follows from
(a1) that the codomain is Type. We deal here only with first-order and second-order types (a4). Axioms
(a1) and (a2) entail that entities are partitioned into individuals and types (t1), (t2).



**a1** Type( _x_ ) _↔_ _3_ ( _∃y_ ( _y_ :: _x_ ))

**a2** Individual( _x_ ) _↔_ _2_ ( _¬∃y_ ( _y_ :: _x_ ))


**a3** _x_ :: _y →_ (Type( _x_ ) _∨_ Individual( _x_ ))



**a4** _¬∃x, y, z_ (Type( _x_ ) _∧_ _x_ :: _y ∧_ _y_ :: _z_ )


**t1** Individual( _x_ ) _∨_ Type( _x_ )


**t2** _¬∃x_ (Individual( _x_ ) _∧_ Type( _x_ ))



We introduce the _specialization_ relation between types ( _⊑_ ) defining it in terms of necessary extensional
inclusion (a5), i.e., inclusion of their instances. Proper specialization ( _<_ ) is defined in the usual way
(d1). By means of (a5), it follows that the specialization relation is quasi-reflexive (t3) and transitive (t4).
Whenever two types have a common instance, they must share a supertype or a subtype for this instance
(a6).



**a5** _x ⊑_ _y ↔_ Type( _x_ ) _∧_ Type( _y_ ) _∧_ _2_ ( _∀z_ ( _z_ :: _x →_ _z_ :: _y_ ))


_def_
**d1** _x < y_ = _x ⊑_ _y ∧¬_ ( _y ⊑_ _x_ )



**t3** _x ⊑_ _y →_ ( _x ⊑_ _x ∧_ _y ⊑_ _y_ )


**t4** _x ⊑_ _y ∧_ _y ⊑_ _z →_ _x ⊑_ _z_



**a6** _∀t_ 1 _, t_ 2 _, x_ (( _x_ :: _t_ 1 _∧_ _x_ :: _t_ 2 _∧¬_ ( _t_ 1 _⊑_ _t_ 2) _∧¬_ ( _t_ 2 _⊑_ _t_ 1)) _→_ ( _∃t_ 3( _t_ 1 _⊑_ _t_ 3 _∧_ _t_ 2 _⊑_ _t_ 3 _∧_ _x_ :: _t_ 3) _∨_
_∃t_ 3( _t_ 3 _⊑_ _t_ 1 _∧_ _t_ 3 _⊑_ _t_ 2 _∧_ _x_ :: _t_ 3)))


Among the individuals, there are concrete individuals (a7) and abstract individuals (a8)–(a10). Concrete individuals are further differentiated into endurants (a11) and perdurants (a12). The classification of
individuals into concrete and abstract individuals (a9), as well as the classification of concrete individuals
into endurants and perdurants (a13)–(a14), are disjoint and complete.



**a7** ConcreteIndividual( _x_ ) _→_ Individual( _x_ )


**a8** AbstractIndividual( _x_ ) _→_ Individual( _x_ )


**a9** ConcreteIndividual( _x_ ) _→¬_ AbstractIndividual( _x_ )


**a10** Individual( _x_ ) _↔_ ConcreteIndividual( _x_ ) _∨_
AbstractIndividual( _x_ )



**a11** Endurant( _x_ ) _→_ ConcreteIndividual( _x_ )


**a12** Perdurant( _x_ ) _→_ ConcreteIndividual( _x_ )


**a13** Endurant( _x_ ) _→¬_ Perdurant( _x_ )


**a14** ConcreteIndividual( _x_ ) _↔_ Endurant( _x_ ) _∨_
Perdurant( _x_ )



Moreover, types are classified into types of endurants and types of perdurants (a15)–(a17), which are
both disjoint (a17).


**a15** EndurantType( _x_ ) _→_ Type( _x_ )


**a16** PerdurantType( _x_ ) _→_ Type( _x_ )


**a17** EndurantType( _x_ ) _→¬_ PerdurantType( _x_ )


_2.2. Some relevant type qualifications_


UFO includes categories for types of endurants based on their rigidity and sortality. We implicitly
define _rigidity_ of endurant types as rigid (a18), anti-rigid (a19) and semi-rigid (a20), concluding that every
endurant type is either one of the three (t5)–(t6). Also, rigid and semi-rigid types cannot specialize antirigid ones (t7)–(t8).


**a18** Rigid( _t_ ) _↔_ EndurantType( _t_ ) _∧∀x_ ( _3_ ( _x_ :: _t_ ) _→_ _2_ ( _x_ :: _t_ ))

**a19** AntiRigid( _t_ ) _↔_ EndurantType( _t_ ) _∧∀x_ ( _3_ ( _x_ :: _t_ ) _→_ _3_ ( _¬x_ :: _t_ ))


**a20** SemiRigid( _t_ ) _↔_ EndurantType( _t_ ) _∧¬_ Rigid( _t_ ) _∧¬_ AntiRigid( _t_ )


_Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_ 9


**t5** EndurantType( _t_ ) _↔_ Rigid( _t_ ) _∨_ AntiRigid( _t_ ) _∨_ SemiRigid( _t_ )


**t6** _¬∃x_ ((Rigid( _x_ ) _∧_ AntiRigid( _x_ )) _∨_ (Rigid( _x_ ) _∧_ SemiRigid( _x_ )) _∨_ (SemiRigid( _x_ ) _∧_ AntiRigid( _x_ )))


**t7** _¬∃x, y_ (Rigid( _x_ ) _∧_ AntiRigid( _y_ ) _∧_ _x ⊑_ _y_ )


**t8** _¬∃x, y_ (SemiRigid( _x_ ) _∧_ AntiRigid( _y_ ) _∧_ _x ⊑_ _y_ )


On _sortality_, our basic assumption is that every endurant necessarily instantiates a kind (a21), and
everything necessarily instantiates at most one kind (a22). We implicitly define _sortals_ as those endurant
types whose instances necessarily instantiate the same kind (a23); while a _non-sortal_ is an endurant type
that is necessarily not a sortal (a24). As theorems, we have that: kinds are rigid (t9); kinds are necessarily
disjoint (t10); a kind cannot specialize a different kind (t11); kinds are sortals (t12); sortals specialize
a kind (t13); sortals cannot specialize different kinds (t14); a non-sortal cannot specialize a sortal (t15);
and non-sortals do not have direct instances, their instances are also instances of some sortal that either
specializes the non-sortal, or specializes a common non-sortal supertype (t16).

**a22** Kind( _k_ ) _∧_ _x_ :: _k →¬3_ ( _∃z_ (Kind( _z_ ) _∧_ _x_ :: _z ∧_ _z ̸_ = _k_ ))

**a23** Sortal( _t_ ) _↔_ EndurantType( _t_ ) _∧∃k_ (Kind( _k_ ) _∧_ _2_ ( _∀x_ ( _x_ :: _t →_ _x_ :: _k_ )))


**a24** NonSortal( _t_ ) _↔_ EndurantType( _t_ ) _∧¬_ Sortal( _t_ )

**t10** Kind( _x_ ) _∧_ Kind( _y_ ) _∧_ _x ̸_ = _y →_ _2_ ( _¬∃z_ ( _z_ :: _x ∧_ _z_ :: _y_ ))


**t11** Kind( _x_ ) _∧_ Kind( _y_ ) _∧_ _x ̸_ = _y →_ ( _¬_ ( _x ⊑_ _y_ ) _∧¬_ ( _y ⊑_ _x_ ))


**t12** Kind( _t_ ) _→_ Sortal( _t_ )


**t13** Sortal( _x_ ) _→∃k_ (Kind( _k_ ) _∧_ _x ⊑_ _k_ )


**t14** _¬∃x, y, z_ (Kind( _y_ ) _∧_ Kind( _z_ ) _∧_ _y ̸_ = _z ∧_ _x ⊑_ _y ∧_ _x ⊑_ _z_ )

_t ⊑_ _n ∧_ _x_ :: _s_ ))


Regarding the leaves of the taxonomy of endurant types according to their sortality and rigidity, kinds
and subkinds are disjoint (a25), and together encompass all rigid sortals (a26). Phases and roles are disjoint
(a27), and together encompass all antirigid sortals (a28). Semi-rigid sortals are those that are semi-rigid
and sortal (a29). Categories are those types that are rigid and non-sortal (a30). Mixins are those types that
are semirigid and non-sortal (a31). Phase-mixins and role-mixins are disjoint (a32), and together encompass all antirigid non-sortals (a33). Let _LT_ be the set of the leaf categories of the aforementioned taxonomy of endurant types {Kind, SubKind, Role, Phase, SemiRigidSortal, RoleMixin, PhaseMixin, Category,
Mixin}, it follows that these leaf categories are pairwise disjoint (t17) and complete (t18).

_2.3. Endurants_


On the UFO taxonomy of endurants, Endurant is partitioned into Substantial and Moment (a34), (a35).
Additionally, Substantial is partitioned into Object, Collective and Quantity (a36), (a37), (a38) and (a39).


10 _Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_


Further, Moment is partitioned into Relator and IntrinsicMoment (a40), (a41). Finally, IntrinsicMoment
is partitioned into Mode and Quality (a42), (a43). Let _Le_ be the set of the leaf categories of endurants
{Object, Collective, Quantity, Relator, Mode, Quality}, it is a theorem that these leaf categories partition
Endurant (t19), (t20).

_2.4. Endurant types_


We define an orthogonal taxonomy of endurant types according to the ontological nature of
their instances. Let _PE_ be the set of pairs {(EndurantType, Endurant); (PerdurantType, Perdurant);
(SubstantialType, Substantial); (MomentType, Moment)}; and _PE′_ be the set of pairs {(ObjectType, Object); (CollectiveType, Collective); (QuantityType, Quantity); (RelatorType, Relator); (ModeType, Mode);
(QualityType, Quality)}. We implicitly define these types in the axiom schema (a44). It follows that the
types in _PE′_ are pairwise disjoint (t21).


**a44** - _i_ ( _t_ ) _↔_ Type( _t_ ) _∧_ _2_ ( _∀x_ ( _x_ :: _t →_ _j_ ( _x_ )))

( _i,j_ ) _∈PE_ _∪PE′_

**t21** - _i_ ( _x_ ) _→¬j_ ( _x_ )

_i,j∈{k|_ ( _k,_ _) _∈PE′_ _},i̸_ = _j_

Kinds are also specialized according to the ontological nature of their instances. Let _PK_ be the
set of pairs {(ObjectKind, ObjectType); (CollectiveKind, CollectiveType); (QuantityKind, QuantityType);
(RelatorKind, RelatorType); (ModeKind, ModeType); (QualityKind, QualityType)}. We implicitly define
these kinds in the axiom schema (a45). It is a theorem that all entities that possibly instantiate an endurant
kind are endurants (t22). Moreover, every endurant instantiates one of the specific endurant kinds (a46).
It follows that every endurant sortal is a type in _LES_ = {ObjectKind, CollectiveKind, QuantityKind, RelatorKind, ModeKind, QualityKind, SubKind, Phase, Role, SemiRigidSortal} (t23); and that some sortals
specialize specific kinds (t24).

_Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_ 11


We have as theorems that the leaves of the taxonomy of endurant types— _LET_ = {ObjectKind, CollectiveKind, QuantityKind, SubKind, RelatorKind, ModeKind, QualityKind, SemiRigidSortal, Category,
Phase, Mixin, Role, PhaseMixin, RoleMixin}—are pairwise disjoint (t25); and that every endurant type is
a type in _LET_ (t26).

_2.5. Mereology_


In the axioms (a47)–(a52) we formalize general extensional mereology (see Hovda, 2009). We present
here the main axioms and definitions; for the purposes of the subsequent definitions, that suffices.


**a47** P( _x, x_ ) (reflexivity)

**a48** P( _x, y_ ) _∧_ P( _y, x_ ) _→_ _x_ = _y_ (anti-symmetry)

**a49** P( _x, y_ ) _∧_ P( _y, z_ ) _→_ P( _x, z_ ) (transitivity)

**a50** O( _x, y_ ) _↔∃z_ (P( _z, x_ ) _∧_ P( _z, y_ )) (Overlap)

**a51** _¬_ P( _y, x_ ) _→∃z_ (P( _z, y_ ) _∧¬_ O( _z, x_ )) (Strong supplementation)

**a52** PP( _x, y_ ) _↔_ P( _x, y_ ) _∧¬_ P( _y, x_ ) (Proper Part)


_2.6. Composition_


We summarize below the treatment of functional parts by Guizzardi (2009). We introduce a relation
F( _x, x_ _[′]_ ) between an object _x_ and a type _x_ _[′]_, whose meaning is that “ _x_ functions as _x_ _[′]_ .” The relation of
_generic functional dependence_ between types is then defined as follows.


**a53** gfd( _x_ _[′]_ _, y_ _[′]_ ) _↔∀x_ ( _x_ :: _x_ _[′]_ _∧_ F( _x, x_ _[′]_ ) _→∃y_ ( _¬_ ( _y_ = _x_ ) _∧_ _y_ :: _y_ _[′]_ _∧_ F( _y, y_ _[′]_ )))


We define the functional dependence between individuals _x_ and _y_ of types _x_ _[′]_ and _y_ _[′]_ (respectively) as
follows.


**a54** ifd( _x, x_ _[′]_ _, y, y_ _[′]_ ) _↔_ gfd( _x_ _[′]_ _, y_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ _x_ :: _x_ _[′]_ _∧_ _y_ :: _y_ _[′]_ _∧_ (F( _x, x_ _[′]_ ) _→_ F( _y, y_ _[′]_ ))


We can now introduce the notion of _component of_ that we are going to use in the subsequent example.


**a55** componentOf( _x, x_ _[′]_ _, y, y_ _[′]_ ) _↔_ _x_ PP _y ∧_ ifd( _x, x_ _[′]_ _, y, y_ _[′]_ ))


_2.7. Constitution_


We adopt here a very simple and preliminary view of constitution. First, it is a relation that holds
between things of the same ontological category (a56).


**a56** constitutedBy( _x, y_ ) _→_ ((Endurant( _x_ ) _↔_ Endurant( _y_ )) _∧_ (Perdurant( _x_ ) _↔_ Perdurant( _y_ )))


However, following Baker (2007), we have that constitution holds between things of different Kinds
(a57). From this, we have the non-reflexivity of constitution as a theorem (t27). Notice that by instantiating
different kinds, constituent and constituted obey different principles of identity, and have different modal
properties (including different essential parts). [7]


**a57** constitutedBy( _x, y_ ) _∧_ ( _x_ :: _x_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ ( _y_ :: _y_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ Kind( _x_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ Kind( _y_ _[′]_ ) _→_ _x_ _[′]_ _̸_ = _y_ _[′]_


**t27** _¬_ constitutedBy( _x, x_ )


7Thomson (1998) requires the following condition to hold in constitution: _“there must be at least one essential part of the_
_constituent, and no part of the constituent is essential to the constituted”_ .


12 _Giancarlo Guizzardi et al. / UFO: Unified Foundational Ontology_


Any complete theory of constitution should explain why material properties of the constituent are systematically related to those of the constituted. Typically, for physical endurants, the spatial location of the
former are inherited by the latter [8] ; for perdurants, the temporal properties of the former are constrained
by the latter [9] . However, these derived relations can apply to many other properties, e.g., the weight, volume, color, chemical structure of the statue are derived from the properties of the constituting clay (Baker,
2007). Now, it would be hard to defend that these derivation relations work the other way around as well
(e.g., that the weight, volume, color, chemical structure of the lump of clay are derived from the properties
of the constituted statue). In fact, although it is natural to conceptualize _The Beatles_ as being constituted
by collective of John, Paul, George, Ringo, it is utterly unnatural to conceptualize the collective as being
constituted by _The Beatles_ . Why is that? We believe that this is because constitution relies on a notion of
_grounding_ . This seems to also explain requirements such as the one proposed by Baker (2007) that _special_
_circumstances_ must hold for the constituent to constitute the constituted (e.g., for the clay to constitute the
statue, an intentional act of the sculptor is required), and that these circumstances are both necessary and
sufficient.
This asymmetry is also often framed in terms of asymmetric cases of dependence (again, strongly
connected to grounding). For example, every instance of statue of clay must be constituted by a particular
lump of clay, but not the other way around, i.e., lumps of clay can exist without constituting statues. In
other words, statues of clay are _generically dependent_ on the type Lump of Clay. This can be captured
with the notions of Generic Constitutional Dependence (GCD), between types _x_ _[′]_ and _y_ _[′]_, as well as the
type-level relation of Constitution (a59) between _x_ of type _x_ _[′]_, and _y_ of type _y_ _[′]_ .


**a58** GCD( _x_ _[′]_ _, y_ _[′]_ ) _↔∀x_ ( _x_ :: _x_ _[′]_ ) _→∃y_ ( _y_ :: _y_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ constitutedBy( _x, y_ )

**a59** Constitution( _x, x_ _[′]_ _, y, y_ _[′]_ ) _↔_ ( _x_ :: _x_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ ( _y_ :: _y_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ GCD( _x_ _[′]_ _, y_ _[′]_ ) _∧_ constitutedBy( _x, y_ )


Now, using another example, we can have a Boxing Match being constituted by one or more punches
(again, an asymmetric dependence). In this case, however, a specific Boxing Match is constituted by
specific punching events, i.e., a case of _specific dependence_ . This is because we are dealing here with a
constitution relation between events and, as previously discussed, events are modally fragile entities and,
hence, all their parts and constituents are necessary constituents (a60).


**a60** _∀x, y_ Perdurant( _x_ ) _∧_ constitutedBy( _x, y_ ) _→_ _2_ (ex( _x_ ) _→_ constitutedBy( _x, y_ ))


In light of these notions of dependence, constitution seems to be similar to the relation of functional
parthood ( _componentOf_ ). ComponentOf is a material relation (Guizzardi, 2009) that also requires “special
circumstances” in order to hold. Due to the different configurations involving different types of dependence relations holding between functional parts, functional parthood is not irrestrictively transitive. In
fact, transitivity only holds in certain scopes defined by these “special circumstances” (Guizzardi, 2009).
Maybe an analogous case can be made to explain why transitivity does not seem to hold for constitution
irrestrictively either. For example, the human tissue that constitutes Paul McCartney does not constitute
_The Beatles_ . Perhaps, like parthood (Guizzardi, 2005), constitution is not a single relation but a family of
relations, each requiring additional axioms extending a very minimal common core.
Again, we advocate that a complete theory of constitution requires a proper theory of grounding. For this
reason, we postpone proposing a complete theory for the former relation in UFO until we can fully advance
a complete theory of the latter relation. In any case, to honor this strong intuition based on grounding
(which is asymmetric) and asymmetric dependence, we assume here that constitution is an asymmetric
relation (a61).

8We do admit, however, relations of constitution between non-physical endurants (Wang et al., 2014a).
9For the case of parthood between events (Benevides et al., 2019b), we have that the temporal interval framing the parts are
part of the one framing the whole. _Mutatis mutandis_, for the case of constitution between events, we assume the same here for
the relation between the temporal interval framing the constituent and the one framing the constituted.
