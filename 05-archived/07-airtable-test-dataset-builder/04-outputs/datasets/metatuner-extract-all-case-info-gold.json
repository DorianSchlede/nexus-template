This will be running from 15th April to 6th May\nacross all markets.\n\n\n\nFor the time being, we won't be booking any specific tenancies as we won't\nhave the budget to support. If the performance is slower than expected, we\nmay review any last min availability that you may have.\n\n\n\nPlease could you confirm, for our brand pages what creative/ copy updates\nare required?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nSanthi",

This will be running from 15th April to 6th May\nacross all markets.\n\n\n\nFor the time being, we won't be booking any specific tenancies as we won't\nhave the budget to support. If the performance is slower than expected, we\nmay review any last min availability that you may have.\n\n\n\nPlease could you confirm, for our brand pages what creative/ copy updates\nare required?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nSanthi",

Happy for it to go live.\n\nFor the push notification, if we can’t split between the two, can we please\nprioritise the Outlet range. We can keep the name as outlet. However, on\nour merchant page, until the 04th may, can we please change the copy or add\nsomewhere on the tile “save up to 25% off + extra 15% off with Unidays code.\n\nAttached are the creatives for the social post. Do you know when we will be\nable to go live with that? Once it goes live, could you please send a\nscreenshot? I’m trying to get some assets for the Airstarit but in the\nmeantime, lets go ahead with the Outlet social.\n\nI believe we have a newsletter on the 20th planned to push the Airstrait\noffer, however we’ve got signed off an “extra £20 off Airwrap” offer to go\nlive from today until the 22nd . Do you think we could use that offer\ninstead? I have attached the codes and the full offer details below. can we\nget the offer live on our merchant page, please?\n\nUnidays\n\nExtra £20 off Dyson Airwrap ID Ceramic Patina\n\nhttps://www.dyson.co.uk/hair-care/hair-stylers/airwrap-id/straight-wavy-ceramic-patina-topaz\n\nUNIAWRCP\n\n16/04/25\n\n22/04/2025\n\n Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n Thanks,\n\nNatalia\n\n-- \n*Saf Burki*\nSenior Salesforce Administrator\n\n[image: UNiDAYS]\n\nVisit our corporate site <https://hubs.ly/H0gSrg80>\nRead our Gen Z Insights <https://hubs.ly/H0cXWGQ0> blog\n\n*UNiDAYS* is the world’s largest Student Affinity Network, with 20 million\nverified members in 115 markets and driving more than $5bn GMV in the last\n3 years.\n\nThis email and any files transmitted with or attached to it contain\ninformation that is private, confidential and privileged.

Happy for it to go live.\n\nFor the push notification, if we can't split between the two, can we please\nprioritise the Outlet range. We can keep the name as outlet. However, on\nour merchant page, until the 04th may, can we please change the copy or add\nsomewhere on the tile \"save up to 25% off + extra 15% off with Unidays code.\n\nAttached are the creatives for the social post. Do you know when we will be\nable to go live with that? Once it goes live, could you please send a\nscreenshot? I'm trying to get some assets for the Airstarit but in the\nmeantime, lets go ahead with the Outlet social.\n\nI believe we have a newsletter on the 20th planned to push the Airstrait\noffer, however we've got signed off an \"extra £20 off Airwrap\" offer to go\nlive from today until the 22nd . Do you think we could use that offer\ninstead? I have attached the codes and the full offer details below. can we\nget the offer live on our merchant page, please?\n\nUnidays\n\nExtra £20 off Dyson Airwrap ID Ceramic Patina\n\nhttps://www.dyson.co.uk/hair-care/hair-stylers/airwrap-id/straight-wavy-ceramic-patina-topaz\n\nUNIAWRCP\n\n16/04/25\n\n22/04/2025\n\n Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n Thanks,\n\nNatalia",

Happy for it to go live.\n\nFor the push notification, if we can’t split between the two, can we please\nprioritise the Outlet range. We can keep the name as outlet. However, on\nour merchant page, until the 04th may, can we please change the copy or add\nsomewhere on the tile “save up to 25% off + extra 15% off with Unidays code.\n\nAttached are the creatives for the social post. Do you know when we will be\nable to go live with that? Once it goes live, could you please send a\nscreenshot? I’m trying to get some assets for the Airstarit but in the\nmeantime, lets go ahead with the Outlet social.\n\nI believe we have a newsletter on the 20th planned to push the Airstrait\noffer, however we’ve got signed off an “extra £20 off Airwrap” offer to go\nlive from today until the 22nd . Do you think we could use that offer\ninstead? I have attached the codes and the full offer details below. can we\nget the offer live on our merchant page, please?\n\nUnidays\n\nExtra £20 off Dyson Airwrap ID Ceramic Patina\n\nhttps://www.dyson.co.uk/hair-care/hair-stylers/airwrap-id/straight-wavy-ceramic-patina-topaz\n\nUNIAWRCP\n\n16/04/25\n\n22/04/2025\n\n Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n Thanks,\n\nNatalia\n\n-- \n*Saf Burki*\nSenior Salesforce Administrator\n\n[image: UNiDAYS]\n\nVisit our corporate site <https://hubs.ly/H0gSrg80>\nRead our Gen Z Insights <https://hubs.ly/H0cXWGQ0> blog\n\n*UNiDAYS* is the world’s largest Student Affinity Network, with 20 million\nverified members in 115 markets and driving more than $5bn GMV in the last\n3 years.\n\nThis email and any files transmitted with or attached to it contain\ninformation that is private, confidential and privileged.

Happy for it to go live.\n\nFor the push notification, if we can't split between the two, can we please\nprioritise the Outlet range. We can keep the name as outlet. However, on\nour merchant page, until the 04th may, can we please change the copy or add\nsomewhere on the tile \"save up to 25% off + extra 15% off with Unidays code.\n\nAttached are the creatives for the social post. Do you know when we will be\nable to go live with that? Once it goes live, could you please send a\nscreenshot? I'm trying to get some assets for the Airstarit but in the\nmeantime, lets go ahead with the Outlet social.\n\nI believe we have a newsletter on the 20th planned to push the Airstrait\noffer, however we've got signed off an \"extra £20 off Airwrap\" offer to go\nlive from today until the 22nd . Do you think we could use that offer\ninstead? I have attached the codes and the full offer details below. can we\nget the offer live on our merchant page, please?\n\nUnidays\n\nExtra £20 off Dyson Airwrap ID Ceramic Patina\n\nhttps://www.dyson.co.uk/hair-care/hair-stylers/airwrap-id/straight-wavy-ceramic-patina-topaz\n\nUNIAWRCP\n\n16/04/25\n\n22/04/2025\n\n Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n Thanks,\n\nNatalia",

This will be running from 15th April to 6th May\nacross all markets.\n\n\n\nFor the time being, we won't be booking any specific tenancies as we won't\nhave the budget to support. If the performance is slower than expected, we\nmay review any last min availability that you may have.\n\n\n\nPlease could you confirm, for our brand pages what creative/ copy updates\nare required?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nSanthi",
