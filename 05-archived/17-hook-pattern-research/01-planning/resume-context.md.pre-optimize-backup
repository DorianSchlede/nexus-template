# Hook Pattern Research - Session Resume

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31
**Project**: 17-hook-pattern-research
**Status**: Ready for Wave 1 Execution

---

## Current State

Phase 1 (Planning) is **COMPLETE**. Ready to execute Phase 2 (Wave 1 - Repository Extraction).

### What Was Completed
1. Created project structure with `init_project.py`
2. Defined research question and 12-field extraction schema in `_briefing.md`
3. Created orchestrator instructions in `plan.md`
4. Verified 9 repositories available at `04-workspace/00-ai-native-org/hook-repos/`
5. Added context loading mechanisms and use case catalog requirements

### Key Files
- `01-planning/plan.md` - Full orchestrator instructions with subagent prompts
- `01-planning/steps.md` - Execution checklist (Phase 1 complete)
- `02-resources/_briefing.md` - Research question, extraction schema (12 fields)
- `02-resources/patterns/` - Output directory for Wave 1 (empty)
- `02-resources/hook-guides/` - Output directory for Wave 2 (empty)

---

## Next Action: Execute Wave 1

Spawn **9 parallel agents** to extract patterns from repositories:

| Agent | Repository | Output File |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| W1-01 | claude-code-safety-net | patterns/safety-net.yaml |
| W1-02 | claude-code-tools | patterns/cc-tools-py.yaml |
| W1-03 | claude-code-hooks-mastery | patterns/hooks-mastery.yaml |
| W1-04 | claude-code-hooks | patterns/hooks-evanl1.yaml |
| W1-05 | claude-codex-settings | patterns/codex-settings.yaml |
| W1-06 | tdd-guard | patterns/tdd-guard.yaml |
| W1-07 | cc-tools | patterns/cc-tools-go.yaml |
| W1-08 | claude-hooks | patterns/claude-hooks-ts.yaml |
| W1-09 | awesome-claude-code | patterns/awesome.yaml |

### Paths
- **Repos**: `04-workspace/00-ai-native-org/hook-repos/{repo-name}/`
- **Output**: `02-projects/17-hook-pattern-research/02-resources/patterns/`
- **Briefing**: `02-projects/17-hook-pattern-research/02-resources/_briefing.md`

---

## Research Focus Areas

1. **8 Hook Event Types**: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact, Stop, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, Notification
2. **Context Loading Mechanisms**: systemMessage, permissionDecisionReason, updatedInput, transcript reading, state files, CLAUDE.md modification
3. **Use Case Catalog**: Complete inventory of ALL use cases with source attribution
4. **Architecture Patterns**: SDK abstractions, modular vs monolithic, handler registries

---

## Command to Continue

Say: **"run wave 1"** to spawn 9 parallel extraction agents.

After Wave 1 completes, say: **"run wave 2"** to spawn 10 synthesis agents.

---

## Dependencies

- **Consumes**: 9 hook repositories at `04-workspace/00-ai-native-org/hook-repos/`
- **Produces**: Pattern catalog for Project 14 (Advanced Hook System)
- **Related**: `02-projects/14-advanced-hook-system/02-research/SYNTHESIS.md`

# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
