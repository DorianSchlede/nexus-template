# Resume State

## Current Status
Project created. Planning phase complete.

## Next Steps
1. Create benchmark script (Phase 1, first task)
2. Measure current cache size breakdown
3. Start with Quick Wins (bottom of steps.md)

## Context
- Current startup cache: 84KB (~21K tokens)
- Target: 30KB (~7.5K tokens) = 64% reduction
- Quick wins identified: ~30KB savings with minimal changes

# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
