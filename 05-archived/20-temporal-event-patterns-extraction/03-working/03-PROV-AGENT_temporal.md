# PROV-AGENT: Temporal/Event Patterns Extraction

## Summary

PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV for agentic workflows, providing a rich temporal/event model centered on the Activity-Entity-Agent triad. The paper introduces AI-specific Activity subclasses (AgentTool, AIModelInvocation) with well-defined temporal relationships that enable end-to-end provenance tracking.

## Key Temporal Patterns for UDWO

### 1. Activity as Canonical Event Type
PROV-AGENT validates Activity as the fundamental event construct with:
- Input consumption (used)
- Output generation (wasGeneratedBy)
- Agent attribution (wasAssociatedWith/wasAttributedTo)
- Causal chaining (wasInformedBy)

### 2. Agent Participation Model
Clear participation types for AI agents:
- **wasAssociatedWith**: Agent responsible for Activity
- **wasAttributedTo**: Agent credited for Entity creation
- Multi-agent support within single provenance graph

### 3. Causation and Ordering
Temporal ordering established through:
- used/wasGeneratedBy create implicit happens-before
- wasInformedBy creates explicit causal chains
- Iterative feedback loops (decision_i influences decision_i+1)

### 4. Error Propagation Tracking
Unique contribution for agent-specific temporal patterns:
- Hallucination propagation across activity chains
- End-to-end lineage for root cause analysis
- Layer-by-layer correlation in iterative workflows

## Relevance to UDWO Metamodel

| UDWO Concept | PROV-AGENT Mapping |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Event entity | Activity (with Task, AgentTool, AIModelInvocation subclasses) |
| Lifecycle states | Implicit: pending -> executing -> completed |
| Temporal operators | used, wasGeneratedBy, wasInformedBy |
| Causation | wasInformedBy chains, wasDerivedFrom (implicit) |
| Agent participation | wasAssociatedWith, wasAttributedTo |
| Event correlation | Activity-Entity-Activity chains via shared Entities |
