## Summary

Graph of Thoughts (GoT) presents a temporal model for LLM reasoning as directed graph transformations. Thoughts are vertices (events) that undergo state changes through transformation operations (Aggregation, Generation, Refining). The paper provides explicit lifecycle states for thoughts, ordered operations through the Graph of Operations (GoO), and causation patterns via graph edges representing thought dependencies.

## event_types

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Thought | Unit of information generated by LLM, modeled as vertex; represents a solution state (initial, intermediate, or final) | Chunk 1:17-21, 244-248 |
| Aggregation | Transformation that combines multiple thoughts into synergistic outcome; creates vertex with multiple incoming edges | Chunk 1:344-352 |
| Generation | Transformation that creates one or more new thoughts from existing thought; extends graph with new vertices | Chunk 1:360-364 |
| Refining | Transformation that modifies thought content through self-loop; iterates thought while preserving connections | Chunk 1:355-358 |
| Split | Transformation that decomposes input into parallelizable sub-thoughts | Chunk 1:477-479, Chunk 3:599-600 |
| Score | Operation that evaluates thought correctness and assigns quality score | Chunk 1:413-419 |
| Merge | Aggregation operation that combines sorted/processed sub-thoughts | Chunk 3:658-660, 804-816 |

## Key Temporal Insights for UDWO

### 1. Thought as Temporal Event Unit
GoT models thoughts as the fundamental event type in LLM reasoning. Each thought has:
- **Creation timestamp** (implicit via graph structure)
- **State transitions** (generated -> parsed -> scored -> selected/abandoned -> refined/aggregated -> final)
- **Causal dependencies** (edges to parent thoughts)

### 2. Three-Way Transformation Taxonomy
GoT defines three core temporal transformations that extend CoT/ToT:
- **Aggregation**: Many-to-one temporal merge (sync point)
- **Generation**: One-to-many temporal fork (parallel branches)
- **Refinement**: Self-loop temporal iteration (feedback)

### 3. GoO as Workflow Template
The Graph of Operations represents a **static temporal plan** executed by the Controller:
- Operations have explicit predecessor/successor relationships
- Supports both sequential (`Generate -> Score -> KeepBestN`) and parallel (`foreach`) execution patterns
- Analogous to BPMN workflow with gateways and parallel lanes

### 4. Volume as Temporal Reach
The "volume of thought" metric quantifies **how many predecessor thoughts can reach a given thought** - a graph-theoretic measure of temporal causation breadth:
- CoT: High latency (N), high volume (N)
- ToT: Low latency (log N), low volume (log N)
- GoT: Low latency (log N), **high volume (N)** via aggregation

### 5. GRS as Event Log Analog
The Graph Reasoning State tracks temporal execution:
- Which operation executed
- States of all thoughts
- Validity and scores
- Essentially an event log for LLM reasoning
