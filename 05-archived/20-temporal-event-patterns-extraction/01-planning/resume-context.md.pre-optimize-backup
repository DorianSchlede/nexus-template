# Resume Context

## Current State
- Phase: COMPLETE
- Papers analyzed: 11/11
- Papers validated: 11/11
- Synthesis outputs: 5/5

## Key Decisions Made
- Research question: "What are the temporal and event patterns across foundational ontologies?"
- Papers analyzed: 11 (6 priority + 5 secondary)
- Source: Existing corpus from Project 16 (no download needed)
- Extraction schema: 11 temporal-specific fields

## Completed Work
- [x] Phase 1: Planning complete
- [x] Phase 2: 6 priority papers extracted
- [x] Phase 3: 5 secondary papers extracted
- [x] Phase 4: Synthesis outputs generated
- [x] Phase 5: Validation and closure

- 03-working/19-Graph_of_Thoughts_temporal.md
- 03-working/20-Agentic_RAG_temporal.md

## Synthesis Outputs Generated
- 04-outputs/temporal_vocabulary.yaml (20 relations, 12 participation types)
- 04-outputs/event_entity_model.md (canonical Event definition)
- 04-outputs/lifecycle_fsm.md (8 FSM templates)
- 04-outputs/agent_event_patterns.md (participation taxonomy)
- 04-outputs/temporal_synthesis.md (cross-paper synthesis)

## Key Findings

### Temporal Vocabulary
- 20 temporal relations standardized (before, after, directly-follows, causes, etc.)
- 12 participation types (performs, initiates, delegates, etc.)
- Entity-local directly-follows preferred over global ordering

### Event Entity Model
- Events are perdurants that unfold in time
- Modal fragility: events cannot be different from what they are
- Essential: id, type, timestamp
- Optional: end_timestamp, lifecycle_state

### Lifecycle FSM Templates
- XES Standard (8 states)
- OCEL Object (5 states)
- Agentic Workflow (6 states)
- Plus 5 more templates

### Agent-Event Patterns
- Coordinator-Specialist pattern (Agentic RAG)
- Hierarchical Delegation (Multi-Agent)
- Task Instance (Event KG)
- PROV Association/Attribution

## Project Status
PROJECT COMPLETE - All deliverables generated

# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
