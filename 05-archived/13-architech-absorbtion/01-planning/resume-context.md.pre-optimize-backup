# Architech Absorbtion - Resume State

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-01
**Phase**: COMPLETE
**Status**: Project finished - 6/6 pattern extractions documented

---

## MANDATORY LOAD

**Claude MUST read these files before proceeding:**

| Shortcut | Path | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| `~plan` | [01-planning/plan.md](01-planning/plan.md) | Full pattern specs |
| `~steps` | [01-planning/steps.md](01-planning/steps.md) | Extraction phases - ALL COMPLETE |

---

## Final State

**PROJECT 13 COMPLETE - ALL 6 PATTERN EXTRACTIONS DONE**

Extraction docs created in `02-resources/extractions/`:

| Pattern | Extraction Doc | Status | Content |
|---------|----------------|--------|---------|
| **C+D** | `extraction-CD-shortcuts.md` | ✅ DONE | Dynamic registry + resolver architecture |
| **2** | `extraction-2-entity-system.md` | ✅ DONE | Full 01-SYSTEM layer (12 entity types) |
| **6** | `extraction-6-meta-layer.md` | ✅ DONE | META control plane + agent memory |
| **4** | `extraction-4-resume.md` | ✅ DONE | Handoff protocol + state machine |
| **3** | `extraction-3-gates.md` | ✅ DONE | PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED framework |
| **5** | `extraction-5-assessment.md` | ✅ DONE | BLACK HOLE + self-assessment loop |

---

## Project Outcome

This was an **EXTRACTION + PLANNING** project. No implementation was done.

**Deliverables**: 6 comprehensive extraction documents that capture:
- Architech's dynamic shortcut system architecture
- Entity type definitions and frontmatter schemas
- META layer control plane patterns
- Resume/handoff protocols
- Quality gate framework
- Self-assessment methodology

**Note**: Projects 14-19 already exist with different purposes. The extraction docs serve as reference material for future implementation when appropriate.

---

## Key Insights Extracted

> **Self-documenting ALWAYS** - Dynamic frontmatter registry, no static YAML maintenance.

> **Mode system** - `plan`, `exec`, `discover` filter entity types for progressive disclosure.

> **Agent scoping** - `agent_scope` frontmatter assigns executables to specific agents.

> **91% AI failure prevention** - Behavioral safeguards integrated into blueprints.

> **BLACK HOLE extraction** - Extract everything, then compress 15:1 intelligently.

## Optional Remaining

- [ ] Archive legacy Architech notes (`auto-company/architech/`)
- [ ] Optional extractions: Pattern 1 (Mental Models), Pattern B (Context Bundler)

# Validation Gate

Before continuing, you MUST verify you understand:

1. **Project Purpose** (from [overview.md](overview.md)):
   - What problem are we solving?
   - What is the success criterion?

2. **Current Location** (from [steps.md](steps.md)):
   - What phase are we in?
   - What is the next task?

3. **Approach** (from [plan.md](plan.md)):
   - What is the implementation strategy?

**If you cannot answer these questions, STOP and re-read files_to_load.**
