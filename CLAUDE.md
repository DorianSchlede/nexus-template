# ⚠️ MANDATORY: RUN NEXUS LOADER FIRST ⚠️

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, you MUST run the startup script. No exceptions.**

```bash
python 00-system/core/nexus-loader.py --startup
```

**After Context Summary** (if user message starts with "This session is being continued from a previous conversation"):
```bash
python 00-system/core/nexus-loader.py --resume
```

---

The loader output tells you exactly what to do next. Follow its instructions.
