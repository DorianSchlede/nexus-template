# Outbound

Outbound campaign management.

## Structure

- `campaigns/` - Individual campaign folders
- `sequences/` - Email/LinkedIn sequences
- `assets/` - Scripts, templates, copy
- `results/` - Campaign performance data

## Naming Convention

Campaigns: `NNN-channel-target/` (e.g., `001-linkedin-cto-saas/`)

## Workflow

1. Design campaign using `assets/` templates
2. Build sequences in `sequences/`
3. Execute and track in `campaigns/`
4. Record results in `results/`
5. Book interviews -> `03-interviews/`
