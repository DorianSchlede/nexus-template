# Experiments

Validation experiments for testing hypotheses.

## Structure

Each experiment gets a numbered folder:
```
NNN-experiment-name/
  experiment-plan.md    # Design & success criteria
  input/                # Raw data for this experiment
```

## Naming Convention

`NNN-descriptive-name/` (e.g., `002-pricing-validation/`)

## Workflow

1. Design experiment with clear success criteria
2. Collect data in `input/`
3. Analyze results
4. Update related hypotheses in `01-hypotheses/`
