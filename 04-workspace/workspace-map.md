# Workspace Map

> **Purpose**: Document your workspace folder structure for AI context
>
> **Updated**: Set via onboarding or 'update workspace map'

## Folder Structure

```
04-workspace/
├── content/             # Your posts, drafts, and published content
├── ideas/               # Topic bank and content ideas
└── templates/           # Post formats, hooks, CTAs you reuse
```

## How This Works

- **You** organize files however you want
- **I** read this map to find things
- **Skills** save outputs here automatically
- **Builds** deliver final work here

To reorganize: Move files around, then say "update workspace map"
