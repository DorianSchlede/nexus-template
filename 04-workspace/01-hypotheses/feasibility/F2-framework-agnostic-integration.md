# F2: Framework-Agnostic Integration (<10 lines, <5 min)

**Type**: Feasibility
**Importance**: 9/10 (HIGH - Go-to-market requirement)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** we can build & maintain SDK integrations for LangGraph, LangChain that work out-of-the-box with **<10 lines of code and <5 minutes setup time**.

**We'll know when** we have:
- Working SDKs with LangGraph, LangChain
- 10+ developers from each framework community successfully integrate in <5 minutes
- Trace data flows correctly without custom configuration
- Integration guides receive 8+/10 ease-of-use rating
- Auto-import/sync from Langfuse/LangSmith works seamlessly

**Why it matters**: If true, we can capture market share across all major frameworks via PLG. If false, we need to focus on 1-2 frameworks initially and may have adoption friction.

## Links to Business Model

**Linked to:**
- **BMC v3.0**: Value Proposition #5 "Works with Your Stack - <10 lines, <5 min setup"
- **BMC v3.0**: Key Activities "Framework integrations (SDKs)"
- **BMC v3.0**: Key Resources "Framework SDKs (LangGraph, LangChain, Mastra, Letta, etc.)"
- **BMC v3.0**: Key Partners "LangChain, Mastra, Letta, Autogen, CrewAI, Llamaindex"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no integration prototypes)

---

## Technical Validation Approach

**Spike**: Build proof-of-concept SDK for 1 framework
**Metric**: <10 lines of code, <5 min setup (validated with 3 devs)
**Timeline**: 1 week per framework
**Cost**: Low (development time)

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Affects GTM strategy - if too hard, focus on 1-2 frameworks)
