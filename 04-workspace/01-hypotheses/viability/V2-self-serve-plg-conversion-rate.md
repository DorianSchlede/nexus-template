**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 9/10 (HIGH - GTM model validation)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** we can achieve 15%+ conversion from free tier (10 opts/month) to paid tier through product-led growth, with users activating after seeing value in first optimization and hitting the free tier cap as proof of value.

**We'll know when** we measure:
- 15%+ of free tier users convert to paid within 30 days
- Activation metric: users who run 1+ optimization have 25%+ conversion rate
- Average time to first paid conversion <14 days
- Organic signups from framework communities (no paid acquisition)
- Free tier limit (10 opts) creates urgency without frustration

**Why it matters**: If true, PLG can scale efficiently with low CAC (<$500). If false, we need sales-led motion or improve onboarding/activation or adjust free tier limits.

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no product launched)

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Launch free tier (10 opts) + paid tier, track conversion
**Metric**: 15%+ convert within 30 days
**Timeline**: 60 days (need 30-day cohort data)
**Cost**: Medium (product development)

**Risk Level**: HIGH (If PLG conversion <5%, need expensive sales motion)
