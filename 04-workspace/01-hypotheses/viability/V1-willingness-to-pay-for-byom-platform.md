# V1: Willingness to Pay for BYOM Platform (CRITICAL)

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 10/10 (CRITICAL - Business viability with new model)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers will pay $200-500/month for a **BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) platform** that eliminates root cause guessing and reduces optimization time by 50%+, even though they must provide their own LLM API keys.

**We'll know when** we get:
- 15+ out of 20 interviewed developers say they would pay $200-500/month for BYOM platform
- 5+ developers pre-commit to paid pilot at this price point
- ROI calculator shows >10x value ($2K+ time savings/month vs $200-500 cost)
- 3+ organizations approve budget for this category of spend
- Developers confirm BYOM is **preferred** over platform-provided inference (eliminates pricing risk concerns)

**Why it matters**: If true, we have a viable business at reasonable scale (100 customers = $20K-50K MRR) with 92.5% gross margins. If false, we need to find higher-value use case, different pricing model, or reconsider BYOM strategy.
