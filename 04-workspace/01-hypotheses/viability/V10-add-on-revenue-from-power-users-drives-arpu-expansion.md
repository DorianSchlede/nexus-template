# V10: Add-On Revenue from Power Users Drives 20%+ ARPU Expansion (NEW)

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 8/10 (HIGH - Expansion revenue model)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: New for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** power users who hit optimization caps (Pro: 100/mo, Team: 300/mo) will purchase add-on optimization packs (Pro: $3/opt, Team: $2/opt) or prepaid packs, driving **20%+ ARPU expansion** beyond base subscription fees.

**We'll know when** we measure:
- 30%+ of Pro customers purchase add-on optimizations (>100/month)
- 40%+ of Team customers purchase add-on optimizations (>300/month)
- Add-on revenue represents 20%+ of total revenue (not just base subscriptions)
- Average Pro customer ARPU: $200 base + $60 add-ons = $260/month
- Average Team customer ARPU: $500 base + $120 add-ons = $620/month
- Prepaid pack usage: 15%+ of customers purchase packs proactively
- Customers rate add-on pricing as "fair" (7+/10)

**Why it matters**: If true, add-on model scales revenue with usage while capping base price predictably. If false, we may need higher base prices or different expansion model.

- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Add-On Pricing: Pro $3/opt above 100/month, Team $2/opt above 300/month"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Prepaid Packs: 50 opts $100, 200 opts $300, 1000 opts $1K"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Add-on revenue stream (20%+ ARPU expansion potential)"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no add-on revenue data)

---

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Launch with add-on pricing, track usage
**Metric**: 30-40% purchase add-ons, 20%+ add-on revenue
**Timeline**: 3 months (need usage patterns)
**Cost**: Low (pricing experiment)

**Risk Level**: LOW (If add-ons don't sell, raise base tier prices instead)
