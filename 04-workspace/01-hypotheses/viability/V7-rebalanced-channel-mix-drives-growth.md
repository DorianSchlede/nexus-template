# V7: Rebalanced Channel Mix Drives Growth

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 8/10 (HIGH - Growth strategy validation)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0 (renamed from V7 "Partner Distribution 40%+" with more realistic mix)
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** rebalanced channel mix with **Dev Communities (30%)**, **Partner Distribution (20%)**, and **Social Media (20%)** as primary drivers (not Framework SDKs 40%) can drive sustainable customer acquisition with lower CAC and more diversified risk.

**We'll know when** we achieve:
- Dev Communities drive 30%+ of signups (Reddit, Discord, HN, Medium, LinkedIn, YouTube, ChatGPT/Claude Research)
- Partner Distribution drives 20%+ (LangChain, Beam AI, Relevance AI, Lindy, n8n/Zapier)
- Social Media drives 20%+ (LinkedIn, X with AI-SEO content)
- Framework SDKs drive 10% (organic from native docs)
- Website/SEO drives 10% (AI-discoverable content)
- Partner-sourced customers have 20%+ higher activation rate
- No single channel represents >30% of acquisition (risk diversification)

**Why it matters**: If true, rebalanced mix is more achievable and lower-risk than v1.0 (40% Framework SDKs). If false, we need to find the actual effective channel mix.
