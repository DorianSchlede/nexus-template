**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 8/10 (HIGH - Expansion revenue)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** self-serve customers will naturally expand into enterprise deals ($2K-10K/month) as they scale from 1-2 agents to 10+ agents or add team collaboration features, especially with data showing value from capped tier usage.

**We'll know when** we observe:
- 20%+ of self-serve customers expand beyond $1K/month within 6 months
- 3+ customers request team features (SSO, RBAC, audit logs)
- Average account expansion 2.5x+ from initial purchase to month 6
- 5+ customers have 10+ agents being monitored/optimized
- Customers hitting caps regularly (signal for enterprise upgrade)

**Why it matters**: If true, we can land-and-expand from self-serve to enterprise. If false, enterprise requires separate sales motion from day 1.
