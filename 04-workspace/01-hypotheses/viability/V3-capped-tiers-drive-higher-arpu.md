# V3: Capped Tiers Drive Higher ARPU

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 9/10 (HIGH - Pricing model, elevated from 8/10)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** capped optimization tiers (Free: 10, Pro: 100, Team: 300 opts/month) with add-on pricing ($3/opt Pro, $2/opt Team) will generate higher revenue per customer ($300+ ARPU) than v1.0 unlimited pricing while aligning incentives with value.

**We'll know when** we validate:
- Average customer ARPU >$300/month (vs $300 target in v1.0)
- 30%+ of Pro customers purchase add-on optimizations (above 100/month cap)
- 40%+ of Team customers purchase add-on optimizations (above 300/month cap)
- <20% churn due to pricing model concerns
- Power users generate $500-1000/month via add-ons (not unlimited)
- Prepaid packs (50 opts $100, 200 opts $300, 1000 opts $1K) drive expansion revenue

**Why it matters**: If true, capped tiers + add-ons maximize revenue from power users without "unlimited" risk. If false, simpler flat unlimited pricing may reduce friction.

- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "All tiers have CAPPED optimizations (no 'unlimited')"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Pro: 100 optimizations/month, Add-ons: $3/optimization above cap"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Team: 300 optimizations/month, Add-ons: $2/optimization above cap"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Prepaid Packs: 50 opts $100, 200 opts $300, 1000 opts $1K"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no pricing experiments with capped model)

---

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Launch with capped tiers + add-on pricing
**Metric**: ARPU >$300, 30-40% purchase add-ons
**Timeline**: 30 days with 50+ customers
**Cost**: Low (pricing experiment)

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (If capped tiers don't drive add-on revenue, base ARPU may be too low)
