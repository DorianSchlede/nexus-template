**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 9/10 (HIGH - Unit economics)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** we can acquire customers through product-led growth with customer acquisition cost (CAC) <$500, focusing on **Dev Communities (30%)** and **Partner Distribution (20%)** rather than Framework SDKs (10%), achieving profitability with $300+ ARPU and <3 month payback.

**We'll know when** we measure:
- Blended CAC across all channels <$500/customer
- Dev Communities (30%): CAC <$400 (Reddit, Discord, Twitter/X, HN, Medium, LinkedIn, YouTube)
- Partner Distribution (20%): CAC <$300 (LangChain, Beam AI, Relevance AI, Lindy, n8n)
- Framework SDKs (10%): CAC ~$0 (organic from docs)
- Social Media (20%): CAC <$600 (LinkedIn, X)
- Website/SEO (10%): CAC <$200 (AI-SEO, organic)
- LTV:CAC ratio >3:1 at month 6
- Payback period <3 months

**Why it matters**: If true, we can scale profitably on venture capital or bootstrap. If false, we need to raise more capital or find lower-cost acquisition channels.

- **BMC v3.0**: Cost Structure "Bootstrap: $700/mo, Post-Revenue: $19.5K/mo, YC Phase: $50K/mo"
- **BMC v3.0**: Cost Structure "Break-even: 65 customers (post-revenue), 167 customers (YC phase)"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no acquisition data with rebalanced channels)

---

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Launch with rebalanced channel mix, track costs
**Metric**: Blended CAC <$500, Dev Communities <$400
**Timeline**: 3 months (need payback data)
**Cost**: Medium (marketing spend)

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (If CAC >$800, need to reassess channel mix)
