# V8: YC Funding Path for Scale

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 8/10 (HIGH - Funding strategy)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0 (adjusted customer count from 10+ to 35+)
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** we can secure YC funding (or equivalent) by demonstrating traction metrics: 4+ platform integrations (LangGraph, LangChain, Mastra, Letta), 35+ paying customers, and $10K MRR within 3 months of launch with BYOM model.

**We'll know when** we achieve by Month 3:
- 4+ framework integrations live (LangGraph, LangChain, Mastra, Letta)
- 35+ paying customers (validated revenue with BYOM model)
- $10K MRR with 20%+ MoM growth
- Clear ROI metrics proven (time saved, performance improvement)
- BYOM model validated (customers accept providing own API keys)
- 92.5% gross margin demonstrated
- YC application submitted with strong metrics

**Why it matters**: If true, we can raise capital to scale faster than bootstrap allows. If false, we need alternative funding path or stay lean longer.

## Links to Business Model

**Linked to:**
- **BMC v3.0**: Key Partners "YC - Apply Month 3 with $10K MRR traction"
- **BMC v3.0**: Financial Resources "YC: $500K (Month 4+)"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Projections "Month 3: 35 customers × $300 ARPU = $10.5K MRR (YC target)"
- **BMC v3.0**: Cost Structure "YC Phase: $50K/month burn"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no traction yet)

---

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Execute Month 1-3 plan, track metrics
**Metric**: 4+ integrations, 35+ customers, $10K MRR by Month 3
**Timeline**: 3 months (full execution)
**Cost**: High (full business operations)

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (If can't hit YC metrics, need alternative funding)
