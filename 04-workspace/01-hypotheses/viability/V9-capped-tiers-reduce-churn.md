# V9: Capped Tiers Reduce Churn vs Unlimited (NEW)

**Type**: Viability
**Importance**: 8/10 (HIGH - Retention & unit economics)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: New for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** capped optimization tiers with transparent limits (Free: 10, Pro: 100, Team: 300) will result in **lower churn** (<5% monthly) compared to "unlimited" pricing, because customers understand exactly what they're paying for and don't feel surprised by usage-based charges.

**We'll know when** we measure:
- Monthly logo churn <5% (vs industry average 5-7%)
- Churn reasons: <10% cite "pricing confusion" or "unexpected costs"
- Customers rate pricing transparency 8+/10
- 60%+ of churned customers cite "not using enough" (not "too expensive")
- Upgrade rate from Pro→Team is 20%+ (customers understand value at cap)
- Downgrade rate is <10% (caps prevent overbuying)

**Why it matters**: If true, capped tiers create predictable revenue and lower churn vs v1.0 unlimited model. If false, unlimited pricing may reduce friction despite "unlimited loss" risk.

## Links to Business Model

**Linked to:**
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "All tiers have CAPPED optimizations (no 'unlimited')"
- **BMC v3.0**: Revenue Streams "Capped tiers improve unit economics"
- **BMC v3.0**: Customer Relationships "Retention Tactics: Product-led retention (must-have), Data moat"

## Current Evidence

**Evidence Level**: Assumption (no churn data with capped model)

---

## Financial Validation Approach

**Experiment**: Track churn rates with capped pricing
**Metric**: <5% monthly churn, <10% cite pricing confusion
**Timeline**: 6 months (need cohort maturity)
**Cost**: Low (tracking only)

**Risk Level**: LOW (If capped tiers have higher churn, revert to unlimited)
