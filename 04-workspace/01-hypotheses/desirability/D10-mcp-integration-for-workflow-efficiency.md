# D10: MCP Integration for Workflow Efficiency (NEW)

**Type**: Desirability
**Importance**: 7/10 (MEDIUM - Adoption accelerator for subset)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: New for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers who build MCP servers and use coding agents (Claude Code, etc.) will strongly prefer **MCP integration** to review and apply optimization recommendations directly in their workflow, rather than copying changes manually.

**We'll know when** 12+ out of 20 interviewed developers report:
- Currently build or use MCP servers in their workflow
- Use coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) for development
- Would rate MCP integration as 8+/10 importance for adoption
- Specific pain point of manually copying optimization recommendations
- Would use MCP to apply changes with human approval in coding agent

**Why it matters**: If true, MCP integration is a strong adoption accelerator and differentiator. If false, it's a nice-to-have feature for a small subset and we deprioritize.
