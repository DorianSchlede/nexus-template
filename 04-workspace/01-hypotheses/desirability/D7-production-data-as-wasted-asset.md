## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers currently treat production trace data as "logs to store" rather than "assets to utilize," representing massive wasted opportunity for systematic improvement, expanding feature offerings, and extracting business insights.

**We'll know when** 15+ out of 20 interviewed developers report:
- Store traces in Langfuse/LangSmith but rarely analyze systematically
- No process for **extracting insights** or **expanding agent features** from production data
- Specific example of valuable pattern or feature idea hidden in logs
- Strongly resonate with "production data as valuable asset" framing
- Interested in **auto-generating synthetic test datasets** from production traces

**Why it matters**: If true, "data monetization + insights + feature expansion" is a paradigm shift value prop. If false, developers already have good analytics on traces and we're not adding unique value.
