**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers personally value and want our solution, BUT they don't control budget approval and must justify purchases to management with ROI/business value, creating a gap between willingness-to-pay and ability-to-pay.

**We'll know when** 15+ out of 20 interviewed developers report:
- Would personally use/pay for solution (8+/10 interest)
- BUT require manager/VP approval for $200-500/month spend
- Need to build business case with ROI calculator (time saved × hourly rate)
- Specific example of tool they wanted but couldn't get budget approval for
- Would need trial period (30+ days) to demonstrate value before requesting budget

**Why it matters**: If true, we must design onboarding for BOTH developer (user) and manager (buyer), with clear ROI metrics for budget approval. If false, developers have budget autonomy and we can sell directly to them.
