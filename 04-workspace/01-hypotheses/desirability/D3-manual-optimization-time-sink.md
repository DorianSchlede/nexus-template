# D3: Manual Optimization Time Sink

**Type**: Desirability
**Importance**: 9/10 (HIGH - Time = Money)
**Evidence**: Assumption

## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers spend 10-20+ hours per week on manual **agent**/prompt/parameter tuning without clear progress signals, representing a massive time sink that prevents them from building new features.

**We'll know when** 15+ out of 20 interviewed developers report:
- Average 10+ hours/week on optimization (not building)
- Can cite specific example of multi-day tuning session with unclear results
- "Majority of time optimizing, minority building" resonates strongly
- Would pay to reclaim 50%+ of optimization time
- Current tools: Langfuse/LangSmith for observability, but no optimization automation

**Why it matters**: If true, "time reclamation" is a strong ROI story (e.g., "save 10h/week at $100/h = $4K/month value" justifies $200-500/mo pricing). If false, developers may not perceive optimization as time-intensive enough to justify new tooling.
