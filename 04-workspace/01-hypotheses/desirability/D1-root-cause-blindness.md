# D1: Root Cause Blindness Pain (CRITICAL)

**Type**: Desirability
**Importance**: 10/10 (CRITICAL - Core value prop)
**Evidence**: Assumption
**Status**: Updated for v2.0
**Version**: 2.0

## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers building production systems cannot systematically identify whether failures are caused by prompts, tools, data, or LLMs and what exact configurations/sentences/parameters need to be edited, forcing them into a time-consuming guessing game that blocks optimization and causes **continuous anxiety & stress** about their agents breaking.

**We'll know when** 15+ out of 20 interviewed developers tell us they:
- Spent >5 hours in the last week debugging without knowing the root cause
- Use trial-and-error to determine if issue is prompt vs tool vs data vs LLM
- Rank "root cause identification" as a top-3 pain point (severity 8+/10)
- Experience continuous anxiety about agent reliability

**Why it matters**: If true, automatic root cause categorization becomes our #1 value prop and justifies premium pricing. If false, we need to find a different primary customer pain or target a different ICP.
