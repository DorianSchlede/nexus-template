## Hypothesis

**We believe** AI agent developers experience **continuous anxiety & stress** that their agent will break or not work entirely and **adoption pressure** to build new agents fast leading to constant low-grade stress that affects their confidence and wellbeing.

**We'll know when** 12+ out of 20 interviewed developers report:
- Anxiety level 7+/10 about agent reliability (ongoing, not just pre-launch)
- Have pressure to agentify and automate many processes fast 
- Specific story of stress from production agent failures
- Would pay specifically for "reliability confidence" and peace of mind
- Check monitoring/logs multiple times per day due to worry
- Experience stress affecting sleep or work focus

**Why it matters**: If true, emotional pain relief (peace of mind) is a powerful motivator for purchase and retention. If false, we focus purely on functional benefits (time savings, optimization).
