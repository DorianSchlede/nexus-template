# Interviews

Interview data warehouse.

## Structure

- `raw-transcripts/` - Unprocessed interview transcripts
- `analyzed/` - Processed interviews with insights
- `synthesis/` - Cross-interview patterns & themes

## Naming Convention

Transcripts: `YYYY-MM-DD-company.md` (e.g., `2025-01-15-stripe.md`)

## Workflow

1. Store raw transcript in `raw-transcripts/`
2. Process and extract insights to `analyzed/`
3. Synthesize patterns across interviews in `synthesis/`
