    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:66-72)"
    quote: "Maximum semantic interoperability can be achieved via a synonymous alignment, where every term in both ontologies is mapped using only predicates representing equivalence relations."
    description: "Framework comparison establishing a rigorous methodology for ontology alignment. Defines synonymous alignment as the theoretical limit of semantic interoperability where bidirectional interpretation is possible between ontologies."

  - name: "PROV-O Agent-Activity-Entity to BFO Continuant-Occurrent Mapping"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:151-156)"
    quote: "the class PROV Activity is mapped as equivalent to the class BFO process. All instances of BFO processes are instances of PROV activities and vice versa"
    description: "Direct equivalence mapping between PROV-O's Activity class and BFO's process class, demonstrating alignment of the foundational triad's Activity component across frameworks."

  - name: "PROV-O Entity to BFO Continuant Subsumption"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:636-645)"
    quote: "PROV Entity is mapped to a subclass of things that are independent continuants and not spatial regions, in a union with generically dependent and specifically dependent continuants in BFO"
    description: "Mapping PROV Entity to BFO continuant with exclusion of spatial regions, showing how the Agent-Activity-Entity triad maps to BFO's continuant/occurrent division."

  - name: "PROV-O Agent to BFO Material Entity with Role Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:654-663)"
    quote: "PROV Agent is mapped as a subclass of BFO material entities that both participate in some PROV Activity and bear some BFO role that is realized in a PROV Activity"
    description: "Complex mapping showing Agent requires both participation in activities and bearing of roles - integrates BFO's role/disposition distinction with PROV's agent concept."

  - name: "PROV-O to CCO Agent Equivalence"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:676-679)"
    quote: "A PROV Agent is equivalent to the intersection of CCO agents that are a CCO agent in some PROV Activity"
    description: "Framework comparison between PROV-O and Common Core Ontologies (CCO), showing more specific equivalence mapping at mid-level ontology layer than at BFO top-level."

    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:358-365)"
    quote: "BFO represents domains that are not represented in PROV-O, such as those covering spatial and temporal regions. Thus, not every term in BFO can be mapped to some term in PROV-O"
    description: "Comparison of scope: BFO as upper ontology has broader domain than PROV-O (provenance-specific), making total BFO-to-PROV alignment impossible but PROV-to-BFO total alignment achievable."

    quote: "PROV Influence, as the superclass of 16 Qualified Influence classes, is mapped to a subclass of the disjoint union of BFO process and BFO process boundary"
    description: "Framework comparison showing PROV's Influence (capacity) concept maps to BFO's occurrent side as processes or instantaneous boundaries, not as dispositions despite PROV definition."

  - name: "PROV Role to BFO Role Subsumption"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 2:103-113)"
    quote: "PROV Role is defined as 'the function of an entity or agent with respect to an activity'... we map PROV Role directly as a subclass of BFO role on the grounds that a PROV Role is externally determined"
    description: "Application of BFO's function/role distinction to PROV: PROV Role maps to BFO role (not function) because it is externally determined by context rather than physical makeup."

  - name: "PROV Plan to CCO Information Content Entity"
    chunk_ref: "04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 2:116-124)"
    quote: "PROV Plan is mapped to a subclass of CCO Information Content Entity... it is worth noting that PROV Plan is not mapped to CCO Plan"

  - name: "DOLCE Participation Relation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:134-137)"
    quote: "The relation connecting endurants and perdurants is called participation. An endurant can be in time by participating in a perdurant, and perdurants happen in time by having endurants as participants"

  - name: "DOLCE Quality-Quale Mechanism"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:166-181)"
    quote: "To compare qualities of the same kind... the category of quale is introduced. A quale is the position occupied by an individual quality within a quality space"

  - name: "DOLCE Role as Anti-Rigid Founded Concept"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:184-189)"
    quote: "Roles are represented as (social) concepts, which are connected to other entities... Roles are concepts that are anti-rigid and founded, meaning that (i) they have dynamic properties and (ii) they have a relational nature"
    description: "DOLCE Role definition using OntoClean meta-properties (anti-rigid, founded) - contrasts with BFO Role as externally-grounded realizable entity. Both share relational/contextual nature."

  - name: "DOLCE Constitution vs Composition Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:206-213)"

    description: "BFO's realizable entity taxonomy showing role, disposition, capability, and function as subtypes - distinct from DOLCE's quality-based approach."

  - name: "BFO Role as Externally-Grounded Realizable"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:269-274)"
    quote: "A role is a realizable entity which exists because the bearer is in some special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances in which the bearer does not have to be"
    description: "BFO Role definition: externally grounded, optional, not reflecting physical makeup - comparable to DOLCE's anti-rigid founded concept definition."

  - name: "BFO Disposition as Internally-Grounded Realizable"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:333-338)"

  - name: "BFO Function as Evolved or Designed Disposition"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:385-393)"

    description: "BFO Function as special disposition with etiological component (evolution or design) - distinguishes biological functions from artifactual functions."

  - name: "BFO Artifactual vs Biological Function"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:434-451)"
    quote: "An artifactual function is a function whose bearer's physical make-up has been designed and made intentionally... A biological function is a function whose bearer is part of an organism"
    description: "BFO subdivides function into artifactual (designed) and biological (evolved) - relevant for distinguishing AI agent functions from human role-based functions."

  - name: "BFO Process Measurement via Instantiation"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes (Chunk 1:794-801)"
    quote: "motion p has speed v... should be interpreted as being of the form: motion p instance_of universal motion with speed v"
    description: "BFO treats process attributes via instantiation of determinate universals rather than quality inherence - contrasts with quality-based approach for continuants."
