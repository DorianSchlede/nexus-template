  - name: "BFO Continuant Hierarchy - 18 Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:66-88)"
    quote: "continuant, independent continuant, material entity, object, fiat object part, object aggregate, object boundary, site, dependent continuant..."
    description: "BFO 1.1 defines a comprehensive continuant hierarchy with approximately 18 distinct entity types organized in a tree structure. This includes independent continuants (material entities, objects, fiat object parts, object aggregates, object boundaries, sites) and dependent continuants (generically dependent, specifically dependent - qualities, realizable entities including roles, dispositions, capabilities, functions). The spatial regions add another 4 types."

  - name: "BFO Occurrent Hierarchy - 16 Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:92-108)"
    quote: "occurrent, processual entity, process, process boundary, process aggregate, fiat process part, spatiotemporal region, scattered spatiotemporal region..."
    description: "BFO 1.1 occurrents comprise approximately 16 entity types: processual entities (process, process boundary, process aggregate, fiat process part), spatiotemporal regions (scattered, connected, instant, interval), and temporal regions (scattered, connected, instant, interval). This demonstrates BFO's comprehensive yet small upper-level ontology design philosophy."

  - name: "BFO Small by Design - 34 Total Terms"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:280-290)"
    quote: "BFO is, by the standards predominant in contemporary ontology, very small, consisting of just 34 terms (see Figure 2), including both familiar terms such as 'process', 'object', 'function'"
    description: "BFO is deliberately designed to be very small with only 34 terms total. This small entity count reflects the principle that top-level ontology should not contain domain-specific terms like 'cell', 'death', or 'plant' - those belong in domain ontology modules of narrower scope. The 34 terms provide upper-level categories common across domain ontologies."

  - name: "BFO Modularity Principle for Entity Count"
    chunk_ref: "06-BFO_Function_Role_Disposition (Chunk 1:48-52)"
    quote: "It is deliberately designed to be very small, so that it may represent in a consistent fashion those upper-level categories common to domain ontologies developed by scientists in different fields."
    description: "BFO's entity count reflects modularity and division of expertise principles. The small count (~34 entities) exists specifically to provide consistency across domain ontologies while allowing domain-specific entities to be added at lower levels. Entity count is purposefully minimized at the foundational level."

  - name: "Gene Ontology - 30,000 Terms in Three Ontologies"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:193-195)"
    quote: "The GO consists of three sub-ontologies, together comprehending some 30,000 terms representing types and subtypes of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components."
    description: "The Gene Ontology demonstrates how domain ontologies built on foundational ontologies can have massive entity counts (30,000 terms). This contrasts sharply with BFO's 34 terms and shows the abstraction-dependency principle: foundational ontologies are small while domain ontologies can be very large."

  - name: "BFO Bicategorial Structure - Two Fundamental Categories"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:340-342)"
    quote: "BFO, in contrast, is founded on a bicategorial approach which seeks to combine elements of both the three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives."
    description: "At its highest level, BFO has just 2 fundamental category types: continuants (three-dimensional) and occurrents (four-dimensional). This bicategorial structure is the root of all 34 entity types, demonstrating how a minimal foundational count expands through principled subdivision."

  - name: "Aristotle's Ontological Square - 4 Quadrants"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:447-452)"
    quote: "BFO accepts also the distinction between universals and particulars, it thus recapitulates Aristotle's ontological square"
    description: "BFO's structure incorporates Aristotle's 4-quadrant ontological square: types vs instances crossed with independent vs dependent continuants. This 2x2 structure provides a principled way to organize entities and explains why BFO has both substance/accident and universal/particular distinctions."

  - name: "OCEL 2.0 Core Entity Count - 8 Formal Universes"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:346-373)"
    quote: "We define the following pairwise disjoint universes: Uev is the universe of events, Uetype is the universe of event types, Uobj is the universe of objects, Uotype is the universe of object types..."
    description: "OCEL 2.0 formally defines 8 fundamental universes/entity types: events, event types (activities), objects, object types, attribute names, attribute values, timestamps, and qualifiers. This small, precise entity count enables process mining while maintaining formal rigor."

  - name: "OCEL 2.0 Metamodel - 4 Core Entities Plus Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:279-282)"
    quote: "Figure 1 shows the meta model using a simplified UML-like notation... There are objects and events, and these are typed. Events have a timestamp and any number of additional attributes."
    description: "The OCEL 2.0 metamodel centers on 4 core entity types: events, objects, event types, and object types. Additionally, it includes E2O (event-to-object) and O2O (object-to-object) relationships. This minimal entity count enables rich process representation while maintaining simplicity."

  - name: "OCEL Running Example - 4 Object Types"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:719-726)"
    quote: "Object Type: Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, Invoice, Payment... Object IDs: PR1, PO1/PO2, R1/R2/R3, P1/P2"
    description: "The OCEL 2.0 running example demonstrates 4 object types (Purchase Requisition, Purchase Order, Invoice, Payment) and 8 event types. This shows that OCEL entity counts vary per process domain - a procurement process has different entity types than manufacturing."

  - name: "OCEL Running Example - 8 Event Types"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:732-743)"
    quote: "Event Type: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Create Purchase Order, Change PO Quantity, Insert Invoice, Set Payment Block, Remove Payment Block, Insert Payment"
    description: "The OCEL running example has exactly 8 event types, demonstrating how event type counts are process-specific. Event types correspond to activities that can occur, and the number reflects process complexity rather than ontological constraints."

  - name: "OC-PM Traditional Event Log - 3 Core Universes"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:219-227)"
    quote: "Ue is the universe of event identifiers. Example: Ue = {e1, e2, e3, ...}; Uc is the universe of case identifiers. Example: Uc = {c1, c2, ...}; Uact is the universe of activities."
    description: "Traditional process mining uses 3 core universes: event identifiers, case identifiers, and activities. This contrasts with object-centric approaches that have more entity types. The minimal count in traditional approaches forces convergence/divergence problems."

  - name: "OC-PM Object-Centric - 5 Additional Universes"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:420-441)"
    quote: "Uatt is the universe of attribute names... Uval is the universe of attribute values... Utyp is the universe of attribute types... Uo is the universe of object identifiers... Uot is the universe of objects types"
    description: "Object-centric process mining adds 5 universes beyond traditional: attribute names, attribute values, attribute types, object identifiers, and object types. This increases entity count from 3 to 8 basic universes, enabling multi-object event correlation without data duplication."

  - name: "OC-PM Sample Log - 5 Object Types"
    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:163-181)"
    quote: "o1 Order Apple 3500.0; i1 Item Orange Big; i2 Item Green Small; p1 Package Yes; p2 Package No; d1 Delivery High"
    description: "The OC-PM sample object-centric event log demonstrates 5 object types: Order, Item, Package, Delivery, and implicitly Invoice. Each object type has specific attributes. This shows how object type counts vary by business process domain."

  - name: "Event Knowledge Graph - 2 Core Node Labels"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:624-627)"
    quote: "An event knowledge graph (or just graph) is an LPG G = (N, R, λ, #) with node labels {Event, Entity} ⊆ ΛN and relationship labels {df, corr} ⊆ ΛR"
    description: "Event knowledge graphs have exactly 2 core node labels (Event, Entity) and 2 relationship labels (df for directly-follows, corr for correlation). This minimal entity type count enables representing complex multi-entity behaviors through graph structure rather than type proliferation."

  - name: "Event Knowledge Graph - 6 Entity Types in Running Example"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:127-128)"
    quote: "Order (O1, O2), Supplier Order (A, B), Item (X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2), Invoice (I1, I2), and Payment (P1)"
    description: "The event knowledge graph running example identifies 6 entity types: Order, Supplier Order, Item, Invoice, Payment, and Resource (actors). This demonstrates how a real process has multiple interacting entity types, each with multiple instances."

  - name: "Multi-Entity Process - 7 Entity Types Total"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:83-85)"
    quote: "This process relies on 7 different types of entities. Actors (human workers) and machines (an automated warehouse) together handle 5 types of objects: Orders, Supplier Orders, Items, Invoices, Payments."
    description: "A complete multi-entity process example explicitly counts 7 entity types: Actors, Machines (warehouse), Orders, Supplier Orders, Items, Invoices, and Payments. This shows that even moderately complex processes involve multiple distinct entity types with different lifecycles."

  - name: "Entity Type Derivation - Composite Entity Types"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:893-896)"
    quote: "We reify the relation between two entity types ent1 and ent2 into a new derived entity type (ent1, ent2). That is, we make each pair (n1, n2) ∈ R[related] an entity node (n1, n2)"
    description: "Entity counts can grow through derivation - creating composite entity types like (Order, Payment) from base types. This shows entity counts are not fixed but can expand through reification to capture interactions between entities."

  - name: "Activity as Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:483-485)"
    quote: "For example, if we pick the Activity property as 'entity identifier', we infer entities such as Receive SO, Unpack, Scan, Store, Retrieve, Pack Shipment."
    description: "Activities themselves can be treated as entity types in event knowledge graphs. This demonstrates that what counts as an entity type depends on analytical perspective - the same data can yield different entity counts depending on which properties are treated as entity identifiers."

  - name: "Task Instance Layer - Aggregate Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:702-713)"
    quote: "we extend the graph with a new node with label TaskInstance, resulting in the nodes ti3, ti4, ti6, ti7, ti9, ti21 shown in the 'Task Instance Layer'"
    description: "Process mining can introduce aggregate entity types like TaskInstance that group multiple events. This shows entity counts can grow through abstraction - adding layers of aggregation creates new entity types that summarize lower-level entities."

  - name: "Process Knowledge Graph - Multiple Entity Layers"
    chunk_ref: "11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:698-700)"
    quote: "An event knowledge graph extended with additional layers into a 'process knowledge graph'... Event Entity Layer... Task Instance Layer... Task Layer... Class Layer"
    description: "A full process knowledge graph can have 4+ entity layers: Event/Entity, TaskInstance, Task, and Class. Each layer adds new entity types through aggregation, showing that total entity count depends on how many abstraction levels are modeled."
