  # From 01-UFO_Unified_Foundational_Ontology Chunk 3

  - name: "Quality as Variable Trope"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:6-8)"
    quote: "As for any quality, a Flower Color quality inheres in its bearer (the characterization relation). A perceivable quality takes its value in a color domain"
    description: "UFO defines Quality as a type of moment (dependent entity) that inheres in a bearer and takes values from a quality structure. Unlike tropes in the classical sense, qualities are 'variable tropes' - they can change their values while maintaining identity. This relates to the 8-entity hypothesis by grounding how Data/attributes attach to entities."

  - name: "Inherence as Existential Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:82-85)"
    quote: "inherence is an existential dependence relation and, hence, the connection between a particular quality and its bearer is immutable"
    description: "Inherence in UFO is defined as existential dependence - a quality cannot exist without its bearer, and this connection is immutable. However, the hasValue relation between a quality and its value (qualia) is generic dependence, allowing change. This pattern is fundamental for understanding how properties attach to entities."

  - name: "Event as Modally Fragile Entity"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:103-107)"
    quote: "In UFO, we follow a classical view of events in which events are modally fragile entities. So, events cannot bear modal properties, they cannot genuinely change"
    description: "UFO defines Events as modally fragile entities that cannot genuinely change - they are fixed once they occur. Events are polygenic manifestations of dispositions. This formal definition distinguishes Events from Endurants (which can change) in the 8-entity framework."

  - name: "Role as Externally Dependent Mode"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:129-131)"
    quote: "Jogger is a role played by a Person when bearing a Jog mode (an endurant comprising an intention as well as the capacities of the person as a Jogger)"
    description: "UFO defines Role as a pattern where an entity (like Person) plays a Role (like Jogger) by bearing a Mode that comprises intentional states and capacities. This grounds the Role entity type in the 8-entity hypothesis through the mode-bearing relationship."

  - name: "Process as Life of Endurant"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:161-165)"
    quote: "At each situation, we have a particular type of maximal Jogging Process...that is constituted by (exactly) the sum of Jogging Events that are manifestations of that Jog"
    description: "UFO defines Process as the 'life' of an endurant - constituted by all Events that manifest the endurant's dispositions. This recursive definition connects Events to ongoing Processes through constitution and manifestation relations."

  - name: "Event Partition into States and Locomotions"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:186-191)"
    quote: "Jogging Events can be stative/homeomerous and some are dynamic/sequences of changes. In the former's case, we have Jog State, while in the latter we have Jogging Locomotion"
    description: "UFO partitions Events into stative (homeomerous) and dynamic types. Stative events maintain uniform properties throughout; dynamic events involve sequences of changes. Events are characterized by tropes (immutable properties) rather than variable qualities."

  - name: "Walk Mode with External Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:264-266)"
    quote: "a Walk is modeled as an externally dependent mode that inheres in the Walker and that is externally dependent on Place (that plays the role of an originally intended destination)"
    description: "UFO defines complex Modes that have both inherence (to their bearer) and external dependence (on other entities like destinations). This pattern captures intentional actions with Goals - relating to Goal entity in the 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Relator as Social Entity"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:412-416)"
    quote: "We observe that what remains stable here is a general kind of relator we call Conjugal Relationship between Spouses. Varying constraints established in the social process in time lead to specific types"
    description: "UFO defines Relator as a social entity that mediates between other entities. Relators can have types that evolve over time while maintaining core identity. This grounds social/organizational relationships in the ontology."

  - name: "Higher-Order Type (Powertype)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:419-424)"
    quote: "UFO captures this scenario by accounting not only for the individuals in the domain of inquiry but types as well. This leads to higher-order types, i.e., types whose instances are themselves types"
    description: "UFO supports higher-order types (metatypes) where instances are themselves types. This powertype pattern enables modeling concept evolution and type hierarchies, supporting flexible metamodeling for the UDWO framework."

  - name: "OntoUML Stereotype Taxonomy"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:487-489)"
    quote: "SubKind(MonogamousHeterosexualMarriage) MonogamousHeterosexualMarriage < ConjugalRelationship"
    description: "UFO uses OntoUML stereotypes (SubKind, Role, RelatorKind, ModeKind, etc.) to classify entity types. Each stereotype has specific ontological commitments about identity, rigidity, and dependence that constrain valid modeling patterns."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 1

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Definition (Inclusive)"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:138-142)"
    quote: "we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities"
    description: "Formal definition of knowledge graph as a graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent relations. The graph conforms to a data model (directed edge-labelled, property graph, etc.) and aims to capture real-world knowledge. This is the foundational entity definition for KG-based systems."

  - name: "Entity Definition in KG Context"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:77-81)"
    quote: "Graphs provide a concise and intuitive abstraction for a variety of domains, where edges capture the (potentially cyclical) relations between the entities inherent in social data, biological interactions"
    description: "In knowledge graphs, Entity is defined as a node representing a real-world thing (person, place, concept). Entities are connected by Relations (edges) that can be cyclical. This basic Entity-Relation pattern underlies all KG representations."

  - name: "Directed Edge-Labelled Graph Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:404-408)"
    quote: "A directed edge-labelled graph (also known as a multi-relational graph) is defined as a set of nodes...and a set of directed labelled edges between those nodes"
    description: "Formal definition of directed edge-labelled graph: nodes represent entities, directed labelled edges represent binary relations. This is the foundational data model for RDF and many knowledge graphs, defining how Entity and Relation are technically represented."

  - name: "Heterogeneous Graph with Node Types"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:483-490)"
    quote: "A heterogeneous graph (or heterogeneous information network) is a graph where each node and edge is assigned one type"
    description: "Heterogeneous graphs extend the basic model by assigning explicit types to nodes and edges. This supports Entity typing (homogeneous vs heterogeneous edges) and enables type-based partitioning for machine learning. Directly relates to entity_types field."

  - name: "Property Graph Model"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:548-551)"
    quote: "The property graph model was thus proposed to offer additional flexibility when modelling data as a graph. A property graph allows a set of property-value pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges"
    description: "Property graphs allow property-value pairs on nodes AND edges, with labels for typing. This extends Entity definition to include attributes, and allows Relations (edges) to carry metadata. Used in Neo4j and commercial graph databases."

  - name: "Graph Dataset with Named Graphs"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:583-598)"
    quote: "A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph. Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph"
    description: "Graph datasets organize multiple graphs with identifiers. Named graphs enable provenance tracking, source management, and context scoping. This pattern is essential for multi-source knowledge graph integration."

  - name: "Class Definition in Semantic Schema"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 1:1000-1001)"
    quote: "A semantic schema allows for defining the meaning of high-level terms (aka vocabulary or terminology) used in the graph"
    description: "Semantic schema defines Classes as groupings of entities sharing common characteristics. Classes form hierarchies (subclass relations) and are used to type entities. This grounds the abstract entity taxonomy in concrete schema definitions."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 2

  - name: "Class Hierarchy with Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:113-118)"
    quote: "In Figure 11, we present a class hierarchy for events where children are defined to be subclasses of their parents such that if we find an edge EID15 type Food Festival...we may also infer that EID15 type Festival"
    description: "Classes are organized in hierarchies where subclass relations enable inference. If X is instance of subclass, X is also instance of superclass. This taxonomic pattern is fundamental for entity classification and type reasoning."

  - name: "Property with Domain and Range"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:127-131)"
    quote: "We may further define the domain of properties, indicating the class(es) of entities for nodes from which edges with that property extend"
    description: "Properties (relations) have domain and range constraints defining valid entity types for subject and object positions. Domain specifies source entity type; range specifies target entity type. This constrains valid Entity-Relation-Entity patterns."

  - name: "Open World Assumption (OWA)"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:192-210)"
    quote: "A consequence of CWA is that the addition of an edge to the data graph may contradict what was previously assumed to be false, whereas with OWA, a statement that is proven false continues to be false"
    description: "Under OWA, absence of an edge does not mean the relation is false - only that it is unknown. This assumption affects entity and relation definitions: entities may have unknown properties. Contrasts with CWA where unknown = false."

  - name: "Shape as Validation Constraint"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:251-260)"
    quote: "A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes. The shape's target can be defined in many ways"
    description: "Shapes define constraints on entities (nodes). A shape targets entities (by class, property, query) and specifies required/optional properties, cardinalities, and value types. This validates whether entities conform to expected definitions."

  - name: "Quotient Graph as Schema Summary"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:439-448)"
    quote: "A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some equivalence relation"
    description: "Quotient graphs partition entities into equivalence classes based on structural similarity. The quotient graph summarizes entity types and their relationships, providing an emergent schema from data. This connects bottom-up entity discovery to schema definition."

  - name: "Persistent Identifier (PID) for Entity"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:562-567)"
    quote: "To avoid such clashes, long-lasting persistent identifiers (PIDs) can be created in order to uniquely identify an entity. Prominent examples of PID schemes include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)"
    description: "Entities require unique persistent identifiers to avoid naming clashes across knowledge graphs. PIDs (DOIs, IRIs, ORCIDs) provide global identity. This is fundamental for entity disambiguation and cross-graph integration."

  - name: "IRI as Entity Identifier"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:585-594)"
    quote: "RDF 1.1 proposes to use Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) to identify non-information resources such as cities or events"
    description: "IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) identify real-world entities distinctly from URLs (which identify documents about entities). This separation prevents confusion between entity and description, essential for precise entity definition."

  - name: "Identity Link (owl:sameAs)"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:687-694)"
    quote: "identity links to state that a local entity has the same identity as another coreferent entity found in an external source; an instantiation of this concept can be found in the OWL standard, which defines the owl:sameAs property"
    description: "Identity links (owl:sameAs) assert that two nodes refer to the same real-world entity. This enables entity resolution across knowledge graphs and is essential for data integration where the same Entity has different identifiers."

  - name: "Datatype Value as Entity Property"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:712-721)"
    quote: "Most practical data models for graphs allow for defining nodes that are datatype values. RDF utilises XML Schema Datatypes (XSD)"
    description: "Entities can have datatype values (strings, integers, dates) as property values. These are distinct from entity nodes - they represent Data/values rather than real-world things. Datatype nodes cannot have outgoing edges in RDF."

  - name: "Lexicalized Entity with Labels"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:748-753)"
    quote: "Since identifiers can be arbitrary, it is common to add edges that provide a human-interpretable label for nodes, such as wd:Q2887 rdfs:label 'Santiago'"
    description: "Entities have human-readable labels (rdfs:label) separate from their identifiers. Labels may be multilingual. Lexicalized knowledge graphs support entity grounding through natural language labels for human interpretation and NLP integration."

  - name: "Existential Node (Blank Node)"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:779-798)"
    quote: "some graph models permit the use of existential nodes...These edges denote that there exists a common venue for chile:EID42 and chile:EID42 without identifying it"
    description: "Existential nodes (blank nodes in RDF) represent entities known to exist but without assigned identifiers. They assert existence without identity, useful for modeling incomplete knowledge about entities."

  - name: "Context as Scope of Truth"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 2:833-837)"
    quote: "By context we herein refer to the scope of truth, and thus talk about the context in which some data are held to be true"
    description: "Context defines the scope in which entity properties/relations hold true. Context includes temporal (when), geographic (where), and provenance (source) dimensions. Entities and their relations may be context-dependent."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 3

  - name: "Temporal Context Annotation"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:111-117)"
    quote: "Temporal RDF allows for annotating edges with time intervals, such as Chile [2006,2010] M. Bachelet, while Fuzzy RDF allows for annotating edges with a degree of truth"
    description: "Temporal annotations specify when relations between entities hold. Time intervals constrain validity of edges. Similarly, fuzzy annotations provide confidence degrees. This extends Entity-Relation model with context/confidence metadata."

  - name: "Annotated RDF with Semi-rings"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:120-126)"
    quote: "Annotated RDF allows for representing various forms of context modelled as semi-rings: algebraic structures consisting of domain values...and two main operators to combine domain values: meet and join"
    description: "Annotated RDF uses algebraic semi-ring structures to model contextual domains. Meet combines conjunctive context (intersection); join combines disjunctive context (union). This formal framework supports reasoning about entity properties in context."

  - name: "Ontology as Formal Representation"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:311-313)"
    quote: "In the context of computing, an ontology is then a concrete, formal representation of what terms mean within the scope in which they are used"
    description: "Ontology provides formal definitions of entity types, their properties, and relationships. It defines what terms (entity names, relation names) mean in a specific domain. This is the meta-level definition that grounds all entity definitions."

  - name: "Interpretation Mapping Terms to Domain"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:374-377)"
    quote: "we can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms (nodes and edge-labels) of the data graph to those of the domain graph"
    description: "Interpretation maps graph terms (nodes, edge labels) to domain entities and relations. This formal semantics defines how syntactic entities in the graph correspond to real-world things. Essential for understanding entity semantics."

  - name: "Individual (OWL Entity Instance)"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:473-475)"
    quote: "In Table 3, we list the main features supported by OWL for describing individuals (e.g., Santiago, EID16), sometimes distinguished from classes and properties"
    description: "Individuals in OWL are specific entity instances (as opposed to classes/types). Individuals can have assertions (property values), same-as relations, and different-from relations. They instantiate Entity types defined by classes."

  - name: "Property Axioms in OWL"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:492-500)"
    quote: "We may define a pair of properties to be equivalent, inverses, or disjoint. We can further define a particular property to denote a transitive, symmetric, asymmetric, reflexive, or irreflexive relation"
    description: "OWL property axioms define relation characteristics: transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity, etc. These constrain how Relations between Entities behave. Functional/inverse-functional properties affect entity identity inference."

  - name: "Class Axioms in OWL"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:651-664)"
    quote: "OWL supports sub-classes, and many additional features, for defining and making claims about classes...OWL allows for defining that they are equivalent, or disjoint"
    description: "OWL class axioms define relationships between entity types: subclass, equivalence, disjointness. Set operators (complement, union, intersection, enumeration) create complex class definitions. This enables sophisticated entity type hierarchies."

  - name: "Property Restriction Class"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 3:665-675)"
    quote: "by placing restrictions on a particular property p, one can define classes whose instances are all of the entities that have: some value from a given class on p; all values from a given class on p"
    description: "Property restrictions define entity types by their relationships. 'Some value from' (existential), 'all values from' (universal), 'has value' (specific value), cardinality restrictions constrain entity membership based on their relational patterns."

  # From 02-Knowledge_Graphs Chunk 4

  - name: "Rule as Inference Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:21-35)"
    quote: "A rule is composed of a body (if) and a head (then). Both the body and head are given as graph patterns. A rule indicates that if we can replace the variables of the body with terms from the data graph...will yield a valid entailment"
    description: "Rules define entity inference patterns: if body pattern matches, head pattern is entailed. Rules enable deriving new entity relationships from existing ones. This corresponds to Datalog/Horn clauses and enables automated reasoning about entities."

  - name: "Description Logic Terminology"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:149-155)"
    quote: "Description Logics are based on three types of elements: individuals, such as Santiago; classes (aka concepts) such as City; and properties (aka roles) such as flight"
    description: "Description Logics formalize three core element types: Individuals (entity instances), Classes/Concepts (entity types), and Properties/Roles (relations). This tripartite structure grounds the fundamental entity ontology in formal logic."

  - name: "A-Box Assertional Axioms"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:152-156)"
    quote: "Assertional axioms can be either unary class relations on individuals, such as City(Santiago), or binary property relations on individuals, such as flight(Santiago,Arica). Such axioms form the Assertional Box (A-Box)"
    description: "A-Box contains facts about individual entities: type assertions (entity-is-a-class) and relation assertions (entity-relates-to-entity). This separates entity instance data from schema definitions (T-Box)."

  - name: "T-Box Class Axioms"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:157-162)"
    quote: "DLs further introduce logical symbols to allow for defining class axioms (forming the Terminology Box, or T-Box for short), and property axioms (forming the Role Box, R-Box)"
    description: "T-Box contains entity type definitions: class hierarchies, equivalences, and constraints. R-Box contains relation (property/role) definitions. This separation of concerns enables modular entity schema design."

  - name: "Constructed Class Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:166-171)"
    quote: "we can define a class exists_nearby.Airport as the class of individuals that have some airport nearby. Noting that the symbol T is used in DLs to denote the class of all individuals"
    description: "Classes can be constructed using logical operators: existential quantification (exists_p.C = entities with some p-value in C), universal quantification, and connectives. This enables defining entity types by their relational properties."

  - name: "Graph Embedding as Entity Representation"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:795-803)"
    quote: "Typically the graph embedding is composed of an entity embedding for each node: a vector with d dimensions that we denote by e; and a relation embedding for each edge label"
    description: "Entity embeddings are dense vector representations learned from graph structure. Each entity gets a fixed-dimensional vector capturing latent features. This numeric representation enables machine learning over entities while preserving relational structure."

  - name: "Plausibility Score for Entity Relations"
    chunk_ref: "02-KG (Chunk 4:807-811)"
    quote: "given an edge s p o, a specific embedding approach defines a scoring function that accepts es...rp...and eo...and computes the plausibility of the edge: how likely it is to be true"
    description: "Scoring functions evaluate plausibility of entity-relation-entity triples using embeddings. Higher scores indicate more likely relations. This probabilistic view of entity relations enables link prediction and confidence scoring."
