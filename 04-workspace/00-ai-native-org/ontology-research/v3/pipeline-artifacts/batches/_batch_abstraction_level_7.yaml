  # Paper 20: Agentic RAG Survey
  # =========================================

  - name: "RAG Paradigm Evolution Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:173-184)"
    quote: "This section examines the progression of RAG paradigms, presenting key stages of development - Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, Modular RAG, Graph RAG, and Agentic RAG"
    description: "The paper presents a clear abstraction hierarchy for RAG systems, progressing from simple to complex. Naive RAG represents the foundational/basic level, Advanced RAG adds semantic understanding, Modular RAG introduces component flexibility, Graph RAG adds relational reasoning, and Agentic RAG represents the highest application-level abstraction with autonomous decision-making. This demonstrates domain-level abstraction within AI systems."

  - name: "Agentic Pattern Abstraction Levels"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:507-510)"
    quote: "Agentic Patterns provide structured methodologies that guide the behavior of agents in Agentic RAG systems. These patterns enable agents to dynamically adapt, plan, and collaborate"
    description: "Four agentic patterns (Reflection, Planning, Tool Use, Multi-Agent) represent different abstraction levels for agent behavior. Reflection is foundational (self-evaluation), Planning adds task decomposition, Tool Use enables external capability extension, and Multi-Agent represents the highest orchestration level. This is a domain-level abstraction pattern for AI agent design."

  - name: "Single vs Multi vs Hierarchical Agent Architecture Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:746-749)"
    quote: "Agentic RAG systems can be categorized into distinct architectural frameworks based on their complexity and design principles. These include single-agent, multi-agent, and hierarchical agentic architectures"
    description: "The taxonomy presents three abstraction levels for agentic systems: single-agent (simplest, centralized), multi-agent (modular, distributed), and hierarchical (tiered with strategic oversight). This represents application-level abstraction for system architecture design, where higher levels add complexity and coordination capabilities."

  - name: "Workflow Pattern Complexity Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 1:613-614)"
    quote: "Agentic workflow patterns structure LLM-based applications to optimize performance, accuracy, and efficiency. Different approaches are suitable depending on task complexity"
    description: "Workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, Evaluator-Optimizer) represent different abstraction levels for task orchestration. Simpler patterns like Prompt Chaining are foundational, while Orchestrator-Workers and Evaluator-Optimizer represent higher application-level abstractions for complex task management."

  - name: "Hierarchical Agent Tier Structure"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 2:103-106)"
    quote: "Hierarchical Agentic RAG systems employ a structured, multi-tiered approach to information retrieval. Agents are organized in a hierarchy, with higher-level agents overseeing lower-level agents"
    description: "This describes a concrete application-level abstraction with explicit tiers: top-tier agents (strategic decision-making), mid-level agents (specialized retrieval), and lower-level agents (execution). The abstraction enables multi-level decision-making and task delegation based on query complexity."

  - name: "Document Workflow Abstraction Layers"
    chunk_ref: "20-Agentic_RAG_Survey (Chunk 2:704-708)"
    quote: "Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) extend traditional RAG paradigms by enabling end-to-end knowledge work automation. These workflows orchestrate complex document-centric processes"
    description: "ADW represents a domain-specific application-level abstraction that integrates document parsing, retrieval, reasoning, and structured outputs. It demonstrates how foundational RAG concepts are elevated to domain-specific workflow automation, with state maintenance across multi-step processes."

  # Paper 21: LLM Smart Contracts from BPMN
  # =========================================

  - name: "Process Model to Smart Contract Abstraction Bridge"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:53-58)"
    quote: "Blockchain-based business process execution relies on a model-driven paradigm, where process descriptions are transformed into executable artefacts based on rule-based transformation tools"
    description: "This describes abstraction bridging from domain-level (BPMN process models) to application-level (executable smart contracts). The transformation represents a vertical abstraction relationship where high-level business process descriptions are translated into low-level executable code, demonstrating how ontological concepts at one abstraction level map to implementation at another."

  - name: "Foundation Model Abstraction for Code Generation"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:131-137)"
    quote: "LLMs are a specific class of Foundation Models, a class of machine learning models trained on extensive data sets, not for one specific purpose but as a basis for many possible applications"
    description: "Foundation Models represent a foundational abstraction level that serves as a base for multiple application-level uses. The paper describes how LLMs (foundational) can be applied to domain-specific tasks like smart contract generation (application level), demonstrating the foundational-to-application abstraction relationship."

  - name: "BPMN Choreography as Domain Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:338-341)"
    quote: "In the current instantiation of our framework, we support BPMN 2.0 Choreographies. This is a purely practical implementation choice, given that there is no consensus on the best fitting modelling paradigm"
    description: "BPMN 2.0 Choreographies represent a domain-level abstraction for modeling inter-organizational business processes. The paper acknowledges this as one possible modeling paradigm, indicating that multiple domain-level abstractions exist for representing blockchain-based execution patterns."

  # Paper 22: RPA Framework BPM Activities
  # =========================================

  - name: "Process Characteristic Evaluation Framework Perspectives"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:234-237)"
    quote: "Table 2 visualizes the process characteristics evaluation framework (PCEF). We present five perspectives - task, time, data, system, and human - that contain several characteristics"
    description: "The PCEF represents a domain-level abstraction framework for RPA viability assessment. The five perspectives (task, time, data, system, human) provide orthogonal abstraction dimensions for evaluating process activities. Each perspective operates at a different abstraction level - from concrete task execution to abstract human factors."

  - name: "Task Perspective Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:325-344)"
    quote: "The task perspective refers to the execution of process activities. Its criteria are standardization, maturity, determinism, and failure rate"
    description: "Within the task perspective, four criteria form an abstraction hierarchy: standardization (structural abstraction of process flow), maturity (temporal abstraction of process stability), determinism (behavioral abstraction of rule-based execution), and failure rate (operational abstraction of deviation frequency). This shows nested abstraction levels within a domain-level framework."

  - name: "System vs Human Abstraction Separation"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:377-398)"
    quote: "The fourth perspective in the framework is related to the underlying systems... The last perspective deals with humans computer interaction focusing on the human"
    description: "The framework separates system-level abstraction (interfaces, stability, number of systems) from human-level abstraction (resources, proneness to human error). This demonstrates how RPA viability requires analysis at multiple abstraction levels - from technical infrastructure to human behavioral patterns."

  # Paper 23: UFO Story Ontological Foundations
  # =========================================

  - name: "UFO Three-Strata Ontological Architecture"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:170-193)"
    quote: "The ontology is divided in three strata dealing with different aspects of reality, namely: UFO-A: An Ontology of Endurants... UFO-B: An Ontology of Perdurants... UFO-C: An Ontology of Intentional and Social Entities"
    description: "UFO presents a foundational three-level abstraction architecture: UFO-A (structural/endurant foundation), UFO-B (temporal/perdurant extension), and UFO-C (social/intentional layer built on A and B). This is a canonical example of foundational ontology abstraction stratification, where each layer builds on lower layers while addressing distinct ontological concerns."

  - name: "Four-Category Ontology Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:127-129)"
    quote: "we needed a Four-Category Ontology. We needed particularized properties not only because they were of great importance in making sense of language and cognition"
    description: "The Four-Category Ontology (individuals, universals, substantial individuals, accidents) represents a foundational abstraction level that distinguishes between things and their properties, particulars and universals. This Aristotelian Square provides the metaphysical foundation for higher-level conceptual modeling abstractions."

  - name: "Conceptual Modeling Language Abstraction Purpose"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:113-118)"
    quote: "Conceptual Modeling is about representing aspects of the physical and social world for the purpose of understanding and communication... the contribution of a conceptual modeling notation rests in its ability to promote understanding"
    description: "This defines the purpose of conceptual modeling abstraction: to represent reality at a level that promotes human understanding and communication. The abstraction level chosen must balance formal rigor with cognitive accessibility, making it a domain-level abstraction serving application-level communication needs."

  - name: "OntoUML as Ontologically Well-Founded Language Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:213-222)"
    quote: "OntoUML was conceived as an ontologically well-founded version of the UML 2.0 fragment of class diagrams... the worldview embedded in the language through its conceptual primitives should be isomorphic to UFO-A"
    description: "OntoUML represents a domain-level abstraction that bridges foundational ontology (UFO-A) and application-level modeling (UML class diagrams). It demonstrates how foundational ontological distinctions can be lifted to a domain-level modeling language with explicit real-world semantics while maintaining formal syntactic constraints."

  - name: "Types Taxonomy Abstraction (Kinds, Roles, Phases, Mixins)"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:366-370)"
    quote: "substance sortals (kinds), phased-sortals (roles and phases) and non-sortals (categories, mixins and role mixins). These distinctions were considered to be distinctions among object universals"
    description: "UFO provides a rich abstraction hierarchy for type classification: substance sortals (kinds - identity-bearing), phased-sortals (roles/phases - contingent), and non-sortals (categories/mixins - cross-cutting). This foundational abstraction enables precise modeling of how entities change and relate across different abstraction levels."

  # Paper 24: Enterprise Ontology
  # =========================================

  - name: "Enterprise Ontology Document Encoding Issue"
    chunk_ref: "24-Enterprise_Ontology (Chunk 1:1-50)"
    quote: "N/A - document contains encoding issues with garbled characters preventing reliable text extraction"
    description: "Paper 24 (Enterprise Ontology) could not be properly analyzed due to character encoding issues in the PDF-to-markdown conversion. The file contains primarily garbled/corrupted text (shown as question mark symbols) rather than readable content. No abstraction_level patterns could be reliably extracted from this source. This represents a data quality limitation for this batch."
