  # UFO Paper (Chunk 1) - Agent Modeling Patterns
  # ============================================================

  - name: "Agent as Autonomous Performer"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:52-53)"
    quote: "agentic workflows, where autonomous agents make decisions, plan tasks, and coordinate with humans and other agents"
    description: "UFO positions agents as autonomous entities capable of decision-making, task planning, and coordination. This aligns with the BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) model where agents have intentional states that drive their behavior. Agents are not passive - they actively steer workflows."

  - name: "Four-Category Ontology for Agent Foundation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:116-117)"
    quote: "UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling notions via a set of micro-theories"
    description: "UFO's four-category structure (individuals, types, substantials, moments) provides the ontological foundation for agent modeling. Agents are modeled as substantials (independent endurants) that can bear moments (properties like intentions, beliefs, capabilities)."

  - name: "Role as Anti-Rigid Agent Classification"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:376-377)"
    quote: "roles whose contingent classification conditions are relational, termed roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator)"
    description: "Agents are classified into roles based on relational conditions. A person becomes an 'employee' agent when participating in an employment relator. This role-based agent modeling enables context-sensitive agent behavior where the same entity can act in different capacities."

  - name: "Modes as Agent Internal States"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-322)"
    quote: "Modes can bear their own moments, including their own qualities, which can vary in independent ways. The category of modes include dispositions (e.g., functions, capabilities, capacities, vulnerabilities)"
    description: "Agent internal states are modeled as modes - intrinsic moments that inhere in agents. Dispositions like capabilities, intentions, and functions are modes that define what an agent can do and intends to do. This enables modeling agent competencies and intentions."

  - name: "Externally Dependent Mode for Agent Relationships"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:322-324)"
    quote: "as well as externally dependent entities (e.g., the love of John for Mary, the commitment of Paul towards Clara to meet for lunch next Friday)"
    description: "Agents have externally dependent modes that model their relational states - commitments, obligations, and directed attitudes toward other agents. This pattern captures how agents maintain directed intentional states toward other entities."

  - name: "Qua-Individual for Agent-in-Role"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-328)"
    quote: "a qua individual, which is a mode composed of other externally dependent modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and the same foundational event"
    description: "The qua-individual pattern models agents-in-roles as complex modes. 'John-qua-husband-of-Mary' represents all of John's commitments and claims in that specific role context. This enables modeling how a single agent can simultaneously occupy multiple roles with distinct responsibilities."

  - name: "Relator as Agent Binding Mechanism"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:329-332)"
    quote: "a relator is a moment (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is an aggregation of qua individuals... Examples of relators include marriages, enrollments, employments, contracts"
    description: "Relators bind agents together through reciprocal qua-individuals. An employment relator binds employer and employee agents, with each agent having role-specific commitments. This pattern is fundamental for modeling multi-agent relationships and organizational structures."

  - name: "Agent Participation in Events"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:295-296)"
    quote: "An endurant then participates in a perdurant if that perdurant has a part that is a manifestation of a disposition inhering in that endurant"
    description: "Agents participate in events through their dispositions. When an agent's capability disposition is manifested, the agent participates in the resulting event. This causally grounds agent participation in activities through their inherent capabilities and intentions."

  - name: "Endurant-Perdurant Distinction for Agent Identity"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-288)"
    quote: "UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between endurants (e.g., Mick Jagger, the Moon) and perdurants... Endurants are individuals that exist in time with all their parts"
    description: "Agents are endurants - entities that persist through time maintaining identity despite changes. Unlike events/activities, agents can qualitatively change (gaining skills, changing intentions) while remaining the same agent. This grounds agent identity and persistence."

  - name: "Object Kind as Agent Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:360-361)"
    quote: "Objects (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated functional roles with respect to the whole (Guizzardi, 2009), e.g, a human body, an organization, a computer"
    description: "Complex agents like organizations are modeled as functional complexes - objects whose parts (sub-agents, roles) play differentiated functional roles. This enables modeling organizational agents with internal structure and role differentiation."

  # UFO Paper (Chunk 3) - Agent Modeling Patterns
  # ============================================================

  - name: "Walker as Role-Playing Agent"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:129-136)"
    quote: "Jogger is a role played by a Person when bearing a Jog mode (an endurant comprising an intention as well as the capacities of the person as a Jogger)"
    description: "Agents take on roles when they bear specific modes (intentions + capacities). A person becomes a Jogger agent when they bear the Jog mode. This pattern shows how roles emerge from the agent's internal intentional and dispositional states, not just external relationships."

  - name: "Agent External Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:146)"
    quote: "x :: Jog -> exists!y. (y :: JoggingTrack ^ externallyDependent(x, y))"
    description: "Agent modes can be externally dependent on environmental entities. A Jog mode is externally dependent on a JoggingTrack. This captures how agent intentions and activities are directed toward and dependent on external objects in the environment."

  - name: "Intention-Based Agent Mode"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:258-260)"
    quote: "what genuinely changes is the complex mode (including an intentional component) inhering in the Walker. Due to a change in the intention of the walker, a different walking perdurant will be manifested"
    description: "Agent behavior changes stem from changes in intentional modes. When a walker's intention changes, their subsequent activities change. This BDI-aligned pattern shows intentions as causal drivers of agent behavior manifestation."

  - name: "Redirected Intention Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:335-339)"
    quote: "In the case of a Redirected Walk, there is a new intention, which is aggregated to the original walk and which is directed (again, externally dependent on) a new destination"
    description: "Agents can modify their goals mid-execution by acquiring new intentions. The pattern shows how a new intention mode can be added to an existing complex mode, redirecting agent behavior toward a new goal while maintaining continuity of the original activity."

  - name: "Spouse Role Pattern for Multi-Agent Binding"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:451-457)"
    quote: "Role(Spouse), Spouse < Person, x :: Spouse -> exists y. (y :: ConjugalRelationship ^ mediates(y, x))"
    description: "Role-based agent modeling where the Spouse role is played by Person agents when mediated by a ConjugalRelationship relator. This pattern shows how agents are bound into social relationships through mediating relators."

  # PROV-AGENT Paper (Chunk 1) - AI Agent Modeling Patterns
  # ============================================================

  - name: "AI Agent as W3C PROV Agent Extension"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-280)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow provenance graph"
    description: "AI agents are modeled as a subclass of the W3C PROV Agent concept. This enables AI agents to be first-class citizens in provenance graphs, with their actions, decisions, and interactions fully traceable alongside traditional workflow components."

  - name: "Agent Tool Execution Model"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-291)"
    quote: "an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool) and each tool may be informed by (PROV wasInformedBy) one or many AIModelInvocations"
    description: "AI agents are modeled as having tool capabilities they can execute. Each agent tool execution is an activity that may invoke AI models and produce responses. This separates the agent entity from its actions, enabling fine-grained provenance tracking."

  - name: "Agent Attribution for Outputs"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:291-292)"
    quote: "generates a ResponseData object, which is attributedTo the corresponding agent"
    description: "Agent outputs and decisions are explicitly attributed to the agent that generated them using the PROV wasAttributedTo relationship. This creates accountability chains linking outputs to their responsible agents, essential for tracing hallucinations and errors."
