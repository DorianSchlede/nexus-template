    quote: "user: An attentive HUMAN user... planner: A planner who can suggest a plan... assistant: An assistant who calls tools... ontologist: An ontologist who defines terms..."
    description: "SciAgents defines a comprehensive multi-agent taxonomy with distinct entity roles: user (human interaction), planner (task decomposition), assistant (tool execution), ontologist (term definition), scientist (proposal crafting), hypothesis_agent, outcome_agent, mechanism_agent, design_principles_agent, unexpected_properties_agent, comparison_agent, novelty_agent, and critic_agent. Each agent has a specialized function in the research proposal workflow."

  - name: "Ontologist Agent Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:479)"
    quote: "ontologist: An ontologist who defines each of the terms and discusses the relationships in the path"
    description: "The ontologist is defined as an entity type with the specific function of defining terminology and analyzing relationships. This represents a meta-ontological role - an agent whose purpose is ontology work itself, making explicit the connection between agent types and ontological reasoning."

  - name: "Knowledge Path Entity Structure"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:576-577)"
    quote: "tunable processability -- Allows for -- material extrusion -- Allows for Creation of -- controlled pore sizes -- Achieved through varying..."

  - name: "Hierarchical Structure Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 7:196-199)"
    quote: "Hierarchical 3D Porous Architecture: Engineering collagen into a multi-level structure that enhances crashworthiness and stiffness memory"
    description: "Hierarchical structure is identified as an entity type that spans multiple abstraction levels (molecular, cellular, macroscale). This represents a key pattern for ontology design: entities that inherently contain nested sub-entities organized at different scales."

  - name: "Agent-Tool-Executor Triad"

    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:183-190)"
    quote: "we introduce neighboring relations to denote both the incoming and outgoing relations for a set of entities {e}, denoted as R{e} = {r|<e, r, e'> in G} U {r|<e', r, e> in G}"
    description: "Neighboring relations define the relational context of entities - both outgoing (entity as subject) and incoming (entity as object) edges. This captures how entities are embedded in a relational network."

  - name: "Toolbox Entity Category"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:227-239)"
    quote: "we construct a supporting toolbox for easing the utilization of KG information... we design three types of tools for LLMs reasoning over KG, i.e., extraction, semantic, and logic tools"
    description: "Tools are categorized into three entity types: extraction tools (access KG data), semantic tools (use pre-trained models), and logic tools (manipulate results). This tripartite classification enables structured agent-tool interaction."

  - name: "Executor Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:568-570)"
    quote: "After the planner generates the function call, the KG-based executor will execute it using a program compiler. It can cache or operate the intermediate variables"
    description: "The Executor is an Agent entity type that translates function calls into actual operations. It maintains state (caches intermediate variables) and produces results from KG queries, completing the plan-execute cycle."

    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:536-541)"
    quote: "It mainly contains four components, i.e., the core instruction-tuned LLM (planner), the multifunctional toolbox, the KG-based executor, and the knowledge memory"
    description: "The KG-Agent architecture defines four core entity types: LLM-based planner (reasoning Agent), toolbox (Resource collection), executor (action Agent), and knowledge memory (Data store). This provides a complete agent system ontology."

  - name: "Autonomous Iteration Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "16-KG-Agent (Chunk 1:629-638)"
    quote: "The KG-Agent framework autonomously iterates the above tool selection and memory updation process... the multi-turn decision-making process of the agent is like walking on the KG along relations"
    description: "Autonomous iteration defines a behavioral pattern where Agent entities cycle through: tool selection, execution, memory update, and termination check. This process is characterized as 'walking on the KG along relations'."
