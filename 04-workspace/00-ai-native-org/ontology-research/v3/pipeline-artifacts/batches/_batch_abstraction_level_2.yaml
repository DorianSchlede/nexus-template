patterns:
  - name: "UFO as Foundational Ontology for Domain Ontologies"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:567-569)"
    quote: "Over the years, UFO has been used for the development of core and domain ontologies on a wide range of domains, both in academic and industrial contexts."
    description: "UFO operates at the foundational abstraction level, serving as a philosophical grounding layer from which core and domain ontologies are derived. This demonstrates the hierarchical relationship between abstraction levels where foundational ontologies enable the construction of lower-level domain-specific ontologies."

  - name: "UFO Grounding of Multiple Domain Languages and Standards"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:664-689)"
    quote: "Moreover, UFO and ontologies built with it have been used to analyze, reengineer, or integrate many modeling languages and standards in different domains: ArchiMate, ARIS, DEMO, ISO/IEC 24744..."
    description: "UFO at the foundational level provides the theoretical basis for analyzing and reengineering application-level modeling languages like ArchiMate, BPMN, TOGAF, UML. This shows how foundational abstraction enables standardization and integration across domain and application levels."

  - name: "OntoUML as Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Bridge"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 3:690-696)"
    quote: "A recent study shows that UFO is the second-most used foundational ontology in conceptual modeling and the one with the fastest adoption rate. That study also shows that OntoUML is among the most used languages in ontology-driven conceptual modeling"
    description: "OntoUML serves as a modeling language at the application level that instantiates UFO's foundational concepts, demonstrating how foundational ontologies are operationalized through specialized modeling languages for practical conceptual modeling tasks."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Definition with Explicit Abstraction Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-156)"
    quote: "we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities"
    description: "Knowledge graphs are defined at the application level as data structures that accumulate knowledge. They can be enhanced with representations of schema, identity, context, ontologies and/or rules - showing how application-level graphs can incorporate higher abstraction levels (ontologies, rules) for semantic enrichment."

  - name: "Three-Level Schema Abstraction: Semantic, Validating, Emergent"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:997-998)"
    quote: "We discuss three types of graph schemata: semantic, validating, and emergent."
    description: "The paper identifies three distinct abstraction levels for graph schemata: semantic schemas (defining term meaning and enabling reasoning), validating schemas (prescribing structural constraints), and emergent schemas (automatically extracted patterns). This tripartite distinction represents different purposes and abstraction levels within schema design."

  - name: "Semantic Schema for High-Level Term Definitions"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:101-104)"
    quote: "A semantic schema allows for defining the meaning of high-level terms (aka vocabulary or terminology) used in the graph, which facilitates reasoning over graphs using those terms."
    description: "Semantic schemas operate at a higher abstraction level, defining vocabulary semantics (subclasses, subproperties, domains, ranges) that enable deductive reasoning. They represent the core/domain ontology level that provides semantic grounding for application-level data."

  - name: "Class Hierarchy as Foundational-to-Domain Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:115-118)"
    quote: "we present a class hierarchy for events where children are defined to be subclasses of their parents such that if we find an edge EID15 type Food Festival in our graph, we may also infer that EID15 type Festival and EID15 type Event"
    description: "Class hierarchies demonstrate vertical abstraction within ontologies - from specific application concepts (Food Festival) up through domain concepts (Festival) to general concepts (Event). This pattern shows how abstraction levels enable inference through subsumption."

  - name: "RDFS and OWL as Core Ontology Standards"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:176-190)"
    quote: "A prominent standard for defining a semantic schema for (RDF) graphs is the RDF Schema (RDFS) standard, which allows for defining subclasses, subproperties, domains, and ranges... More generally, the semantics of terms used in a graph can be defined in much more depth than seen here, as is supported by the Web Ontology Language (OWL)"
    description: "RDFS operates at the core ontology level providing basic schema vocabulary, while OWL extends this to support more expressive domain and foundational ontology features. This layered approach demonstrates abstraction hierarchy within semantic web standards."

  - name: "Open World vs Closed World Assumption as Abstraction Choice"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:192-222)"
    quote: "Semantic schema are typically defined for incomplete graph data, where the absence of an edge between two nodes... does not mean that the relation does not hold in the real world... the Open World Assumption (OWA)... Closed World Assumption (CWA)"
    description: "The choice between OWA and CWA represents an abstraction-level decision about completeness assumptions. Foundational and domain ontologies typically adopt OWA (incomplete knowledge), while application databases often use CWA (complete knowledge), reflecting different abstraction purposes."

  - name: "Validating Schema as Application-Level Constraints"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:230-248)"
    quote: "We may wish to ensure that all events have at least a name, a venue, a start date, and an end date... We can define such constraints in a validating schema and validate the data graph with respect to the resulting schema"
    description: "Validating schemas operate at the application level, defining structural constraints for data quality rather than semantic meaning. This contrasts with semantic schemas that operate at domain/foundational levels for reasoning purposes."

  - name: "Shapes as Application-Level Validation Constructs"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:250-261)"
    quote: "A standard way to define a validating schema for graphs is using shapes. A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes."
    description: "Shape languages (ShEx, SHACL) provide application-level validation mechanisms that complement higher-level semantic schemas. Shapes define what data conformance means at the instance level, operating below the abstraction of semantic ontologies."

  - name: "Emergent Schema as Bottom-Up Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:434-439)"
    quote: "Both semantic and validating schemata require a domain expert to explicitly specify definitions and constraints. However, a data graph will often exhibit latent structures that can be automatically extracted as an emergent schema (aka graph summary)"
    description: "Emergent schemas represent a bottom-up abstraction approach where patterns are induced from data rather than prescribed top-down. This contrasts with foundational/domain ontologies that are designed top-down, demonstrating methodology differences across abstraction levels."

  - name: "Quotient Graphs for Structural Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:439-458)"
    quote: "A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some equivalence relation while preserving some structural properties of the graph."
    description: "Quotient graphs provide a formal mechanism for creating abstractions of data graphs, partitioning nodes into equivalence classes. This represents computational abstraction where complex graphs are simplified while preserving essential structural properties for analysis."

  - name: "Ontology as Formal Convention for Term Meaning"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:311-339)"
    quote: "In the context of computing, an ontology is then a concrete, formal representation of what terms mean within the scope in which they are used (e.g., a given domain)."
    description: "Ontologies formalize meaning at their respective abstraction level - foundational ontologies define universal concepts, domain ontologies define domain-specific concepts, and application ontologies constrain terms for specific use cases. The abstraction level determines the scope of convention."

  - name: "Interpretation as Abstraction Between Data and Domain"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:361-395)"
    quote: "we can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms (nodes and edge-labels) of the data graph to those of the domain graph"
    description: "The concept of interpretation formalizes the abstraction relationship between syntactic data graphs (application level) and semantic domain graphs (conceptual level). This mapping is fundamental to how ontologies at different abstraction levels relate to instance data."

  - name: "OWL Language Profiles as Abstraction Trade-offs"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:4-18)"
    quote: "on any input ontology but may miss entailments, returning false instead of true, (2) always halt with the correct answer but only accept input ontologies with restricted features, or (3) only return correct answers for any input ontology but may never halt"
    description: "OWL profiles (OWL 2 RL, OWL 2 QL, OWL 2 EL) represent different abstraction trade-offs between expressivity and computability. Higher expressivity allows more foundational axioms but may sacrifice decidability, while restricted profiles enable efficient application-level reasoning."

  - name: "Rules vs Description Logics as Reasoning Abstraction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:21-52)"
    quote: "One of the most straightforward ways to provide automated access to deductive knowledge is through inference rules... Rules can be used to capture entailments under ontological conditions"
    description: "Rules provide an operational abstraction for ontological entailment, translating high-level semantic axioms into executable if-then patterns. This represents the translation from declarative foundational/domain semantics to procedural application-level computation."

  - name: "Description Logics as Foundational-Level Formalism"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:127-163)"
    quote: "Description Logics (DLs) were initially introduced as a way to formalise the meaning of frames and semantic networks... DLs form a family of logics rather than a particular logic. Initially, DLs were restricted fragments of First Order Logic (FOL)"
    description: "Description Logics operate at the foundational abstraction level, providing the logical formalism that underlies OWL and other ontology languages. The family of DLs (ALC, SHIQ, SROIQ, etc.) represents different points in the expressivity-complexity trade-off space for foundational representation."
