    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:7-24)"
    quote: "Translational models interpret edge labels as transformations from subject nodes (aka the source or head) to object nodes (aka the target or tail)"
    description: "Entity definition through vector representation. In translational embedding models like TransE, entities are defined as vectors in a learned embedding space where edge labels represent transformations. Subject nodes are sources/heads, object nodes are targets/tails. This provides a formal mathematical definition of entities as dense numeric representations."

  - name: "Tensor as Entity Container"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:63-79)"
    quote: "A tensor is a multidimensional numeric field that generalises scalars (0-order tensors), vectors (1-order tensors) and matrices (2-order tensors)"
    description: "Formal definition of tensors as containers for entity representations. Tensors generalize the concept of numeric data structures from scalars through vectors to matrices and beyond. In knowledge graphs, 3-order tensors can encode entity-relation-entity triples, providing a formal mathematical structure for entity representation."

  - name: "Graph as One-Hot Tensor Encoding"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:178-184)"
    quote: "a graph can be encoded as a one-hot 3-order tensor G with |V| x |L| x |V| elements, where the element (G)ijk is set to one if the ith node links to the kth node"
    description: "Formal definition of how entities in a knowledge graph can be encoded as tensor elements. Each entity position in the tensor is defined by its index, with binary values indicating relationship presence. This provides a mathematical foundation for entity representation in tensor decomposition approaches."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:194-205)"
    quote: "DistMult is a seminal method for computing knowledge graph embeddings based on rank decompositions, where each entity and relation is associated with a vector of dimension d"
    description: "Distinction between entity embeddings and relation embeddings. DistMult defines entities and relations as separate vector types of the same dimensionality, with a plausibility scoring function that combines them. This formal separation establishes entities as first-class objects distinct from the relations connecting them."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:465-474)"
    quote: "Each node in the graph is also associated with a state vector, which is recursively updated based on information from the node's neighbours"
    description: "In Graph Neural Networks, entities (nodes) are formally defined by two vector types: feature vectors (fixed input characteristics) and state vectors (dynamically updated representations). This dual-vector definition captures both intrinsic entity properties and learned contextual representations."

  - name: "Node Feature vs State Vector Distinction"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:468-476)"
    quote: "feature vectors that can capture node and edge labels, weights, etc. These feature vectors remain fixed throughout the process"

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:482-486)"
    quote: "given a partial set of supervised nodes in the graph - i.e., nodes labelled with their desired output - parameters for the transition and output functions can be learnt"
    description: "Definition of supervised nodes as entities with known output labels used for training. This distinguishes between labeled entities (with ground truth) and unlabeled entities (to be classified), establishing a formal entity categorization based on annotation status."

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:667-674)"
    quote: "adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that explain a given set of positive and negative edges"
    description: "Entities in symbolic learning are defined through logical hypotheses that explain their relationships. Positive and negative edges define entity connections, with learned rules providing interpretable models of entity behavior. This contrasts with numeric embedding definitions."

  - name: "Rule-Based Entity Characterization"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:676-689)"
    quote: "we may learn the rule [?x] flight ?y => [?y] flight ?x from observing that flight routes tend to be return routes"

    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:59-69)"
    quote: "DL Learner is based on algorithms for class learning (aka concept learning), whereby given a set of positive nodes and negative nodes, the goal is to find a logical class description"
    description: "Entities are defined through learned class descriptions that separate positive from negative examples. Class learning algorithms discover logical descriptions (using DL syntax) that formally characterize entity types based on their distinguishing properties."

When binary relations are insufficient, anonymous nodes formally represent the higher-arity relationship context, extending entity definition to capture temporal and other contextual attributes."

  - name: "Frame Semantics Entity Role Definition"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:306-315)"
    quote: "frame semantics, which, for a given verb (e.g., named), captures the entities involved and how they may be interrelated. Resources such as FrameNet then define frames"
    description: "Entities are defined through their roles in semantic frames. FrameNet provides formal definitions of entity participation (speaker, entity, name) with optional elements (explanation, purpose, place, time) establishing a structured vocabulary for entity role characterization."

  - name: "Direct Mapping Entity Generation"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:597-604)"

This multi-dimensional definition establishes formal metrics for entity representation quality."

  - name: "Ideal Knowledge Graph Entity Reference"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:110-116)"
