patterns:
  - name: "Endurant-Perdurant Participation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:295-296)"
    quote: "An endurant then participates in a perdurant if that perdurant has a part that is a manifestation of a disposition inhering in that endurant"
    description: "Fundamental relationship connecting endurants to perdurants. The participation relation links entities that exist in time (endurants) to events/processes (perdurants) through the manifestation of dispositions. This grounds the Agent-Activity relationship pattern."

  - name: "Moment Inherence Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:299-301)"
    quote: "Moments are parasitic entities and can only exist by inhering in other entities"
    description: "Inherence is the foundational existential dependence relation connecting moments (particularized properties) to their bearers. Moments cannot exist independently - they must inhere in substantials or other moments. This is a one-to-one, non-transferable relation."

  - name: "Quality-to-Value-Space Projection"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:302-305)"
    quote: "Qualities are entities that can be directly projected into certain value spaces. The latter, termed quality structures, are abstract entities delimiting the space of possible values"
    description: "Qualities as intrinsic moments have a projection relationship to quality structures (value spaces). This enables formal representation of attribute values through qualia in quality dimensions or domains."

  - name: "External Dependence for Relational Qualities"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:322-324)"
    quote: "Externally dependent modes inhere in an entity while being externally dependent on another entity"
    description: "Externally dependent modes represent truly relational properties - they inhere in one entity (bearer) while being existentially dependent on a separate entity. This grounds one-sided relational properties like 'John's love for Mary'."

  - name: "Qua Individual Composition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-328)"
    quote: "a qua individual, which is a mode composed of other externally dependent modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and the same foundational event"
    description: "Qua individuals aggregate externally dependent modes sharing three properties: same bearer, same external dependence target, same foundational event. Example: John-qua-husband-of-Mary aggregates all conjugal commitments."

  - name: "Relator as Aggregation of Qua Individuals"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:329-332)"
    quote: "a relator is a moment that is an aggregation of qua individuals... For instance, John and Mary's Marriage is composed of John-qua-husband-of-Mary and Mary-qua-wife-of-John"
    description: "Relators are complex moments that aggregate multiple qua individuals (one from each relata). They serve as truthmakers for material relations and ground multi-sided relationships like marriages, enrollments, and contracts."

  - name: "Relator Mediation of Material Relations"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:333-334)"
    quote: "Externally dependent modes as well as relators serve as truthmarkers of material relations, the first for one-sided relations and the second for double-sided ones"
    description: "Distinction between one-sided and multi-sided material relations: externally dependent modes truthmake one-sided relations; relators truthmake double-sided/multi-sided relations. This grounds the semantic distinction between different relation types."

  - name: "Kind-Instance Identity Provision"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:368-369)"
    quote: "a kind, which provides uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances"
    description: "Kinds provide the identity principles that define what changes an entity can undergo while maintaining numerical identity. Every endurant necessarily instantiates exactly one kind throughout its existence."

  - name: "Sortal Specialization of Kind"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:369-372)"
    quote: "A sortal is either a kind or a specialization of a kind, and every sortal that is not a kind specializes exactly one kind"
    description: "Sortals form taxonomic hierarchies under kinds. Subkinds are rigid specializations; phases and roles are anti-rigid specializations with intrinsic vs relational contingent conditions respectively."

  - name: "Role-Relator Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:376-377)"
    quote: "roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator, and husband as a role of a person in the scope of a marriage relator)"
    description: "Roles are anti-rigid sortals whose instantiation depends on participation in a relator. The role exists only while the relator exists and the entity participates in the relationship it reifies."

  - name: "Substantial-Moment Partition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:298-301)"
    quote: "accounting for both substantial individuals (or Substantials), i.e., independent entities... as well as particularized properties, i.e., existentially dependent entities or moments"
    description: "The fundamental partition of endurants into substantials (independent) and moments (dependent). Substantials can exist independently; moments require a bearer for existence."

  - name: "Object-Collective-Quantity Partition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:353-361)"
    quote: "Quantities are maximally-topologically-self-connected of homeomerous amounts of matter... Collectives are entities whose parts play the same role... Objects are entities whose parts play differentiated functional roles"
    description: "Three-way partition of substantials based on unity conditions: quantities (homogeneous matter), collectives (uniform parts), objects/functional complexes (differentiated functional parts)."

  - name: "Part-Whole Composition Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:874-882)"
    quote: "P(x,x) (reflexivity)... P(x,y) and P(y,x) implies x=y (anti-symmetry)... P(x,y) and P(y,z) implies P(x,z) (transitivity)"
    description: "General extensional mereology axioms for part-whole relations. Parthood is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. Proper part (PP) excludes reflexive case."

  - name: "Functional Part (ComponentOf) Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:909-913)"
    quote: "componentOf(x,x',y,y') iff x PP y and ifd(x,x',y,y')"
    description: "Functional parthood combines proper parthood with individual functional dependence. A component functions as type x' only when part of a whole functioning as type y'. This is not irrestrictively transitive."

  - name: "Constitution Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:918-921)"
    quote: "it is a relation that holds between things of the same ontological category"
    description: "Constitution holds between entities of the same category (endurant-endurant or perdurant-perdurant) but different kinds. It is non-reflexive and asymmetric, grounded in asymmetric dependence."

  - name: "Generic Constitutional Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:959-961)"
    quote: "statues of clay are generically dependent on the type Lump of Clay. This can be captured with the notions of Generic Constitutional Dependence (GCD)"
    description: "Type-level constitutional dependence: instances of one kind necessarily require constitution by instances of another kind, but not vice versa. Enables modeling of material constitution patterns."

  - name: "Existential Dependence Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:117-118)"
    quote: "we implicitly define the relation of existential dependence between two entities, ed(x,y)"
    description: "Core dependence relation: ed(x,y) holds iff necessarily, if x exists then y exists. This grounds inherence and external dependence as special cases."

  - name: "Inherence as Existential Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:138-139)"
    quote: "Inherence is a type of existential dependence relation holding between a moment and an entity of which it depends, called its bearer"
    description: "Inherence specializes existential dependence for moments. Properties: non-reflexive, asymmetric, anti-transitive, non-migratable (moment cannot inhere in two distinct individuals)."

  - name: "Ultimate Bearer Grounding"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:156-158)"
    quote: "Moments can also be involved in chains of inherence relations, which are ultimately grounded on a unique entity that does not inhere in anything else. This entity we will call the Ultimate Bearer"
    description: "Chains of inherence (moments of moments) terminate at a unique ultimate bearer that is not itself a moment. This grounds complex property structures."

  - name: "External Dependence Definition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:189-194)"
    quote: "a mode x that is existentially dependent on an entity that is independent of the bearer of x"
    description: "External dependence: ed(x,y) where y is existentially independent of x's bearer. Captures truly relational qualities where the dependence target is disjoint from the inherence target."

  - name: "Foundational Event for Externally Dependent Modes"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:207-210)"
    quote: "Externally dependent modes (as well as relators) are founded by means of a unique event... John's conjugal commitments towards Mary are founded on the event of the wedding"
    description: "Every externally dependent mode and relator has exactly one foundational event. This event grounds/creates the relational property and defines its existence conditions."

  - name: "Qua Individual Definition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:222-226)"
    quote: "the relation quaIndividualOf holds between x and y iff x is the sum of all externally dependent modes of y that share the same foundational event"
    description: "A qua individual aggregates all externally dependent modes of an entity sharing the same foundational event. Example: John-qua-husband-of-Mary comprises all marriage-founded commitments of John."

  - name: "Relator Composition from Qua Individuals"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:248-249)"
    quote: "Relators are then implicitly defined: they are sums of qua individuals that share the same foundation and are existentially dependent on each other"
    description: "Relators aggregate mutually dependent qua individuals with shared foundation. A relator must have at least two distinct qua individuals as parts, from distinct bearers."

  - name: "Mediation Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:279-280)"
    quote: "We introduce the relation of mediation, mediates(x,y), between a relator x and an individual y that the relator connects"
    description: "Mediation connects a relator to the endurants it relates. Every relator mediates at least two distinct individuals (theorem t33). This is the semantic grounding for material relations."

  - name: "Characterization Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:302-306)"
    quote: "a type is characterized by moment types that inhere in its instances"
    description: "Type-level relation connecting endurant types to the moment types that characterize them. Every instance of the characterized type bears exactly one instance of the characterizing moment type."

  - name: "Quality-Quale Value Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:386-388)"
    quote: "The hasValue relation holds from qualities to quales, where hasValue is functional"
    description: "Qualities are connected to their current values (qualia) via the functional hasValue relation. Each quality has exactly one value at any time, but values can change (generic dependence)."

  - name: "Endurant-Perdurant Manifestation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:505-507)"
    quote: "Any endurant is connected to a perdurant by the manifestation relation... The life of an endurant is then specified by a functional relation"
    description: "Manifestation connects endurants to perdurants that manifest their dispositions. The 'life of' an endurant is the mereological sum of all manifesting events."

  - name: "Employment Relator Mediation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:780-793)"
    quote: "Teacher is a role (contingently) played by a Person in the scope of an Employment relation to a School"
    description: "Concrete instantiation of role-relator pattern: Employment relator mediates between Person (as Teacher) and School. The role exists contingently based on relator existence."

  - name: "Enrollment Relator Mediation Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:801-815)"
    quote: "Student is a role played by a Person when connected via a School Enrollment relator to a School"
    description: "Another role-relator pattern: School Enrollment relator mediates Student and School. Shows compositional patterns where Course Enrollment depends on School Enrollment."

  - name: "Nested Relator Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:749-752)"
    quote: "the enrollment of a Student to a Course Offering existentially depends both on the offering and on a particular School Enrollment"
    description: "Relators can depend on other relators. Course Enrollment depends on both Course Offering and School Enrollment, creating hierarchical relational structures."

  - name: "Generic vs Specific Dependence in Relations"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:751-754)"
    quote: "the relation from Course Enrollment to Course Offering is one of existential dependence (mediation) and, hence, immutable. However, the relation from Course Offering to Course Enrollment is optional"
    description: "Asymmetry in relational dependencies: mediation relations are immutable; inverse relations may be contingent/mutable. This enables dynamic membership in relational contexts."

  - name: "Teacher Assignment Relator Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:845-857)"
    quote: "a Teacher is assigned to a Course Offering by having a Course Teacher Assignment relator that connects a Course Offering to an Employment"
    description: "Complex relator pattern: Course Teacher Assignment mediates between Course Offering and Employment (not Person directly). Shows relator-to-relator mediation enabling role-based assignments."
