    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 1:467-476)"
    quote: "At the core of these systems, intelligent agents structure the system as the foundational components. Each agent is endowed with a unique set of competencies"
    description: "Agent modeling pattern where agents serve as fundamental building blocks of multi-agent systems. Each agent possesses: a clearly defined role, individual memory, access to contextual resources (data, tools, foundation models). The backbone of agent reasoning is LLM incorporation, enabling reflection, planning, task processing, resource utilization, and inter-agent communication."

    quote: "Task-Management Agents: These agents are specialized in organizing the processes related to the task-management activity"
    description: "Three specialized task-management agent types: (1) Task-Creation Agent - generates new tasks and breaks down complex tasks; (2) Task-Prioritization Agent - assigns urgency/importance and resolves dependencies; (3) Task-Execution Agent - ensures efficient task completion. These agents handle meta-level orchestration of work."

Examples from software development include project manager, software architect, developer, and QA engineer. They collaborate with peer agents as needed, representing domain expertise encapsulation in agent form."

  - name: "Agent Type Taxonomy: Technical Agents"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 2:19-21)"
    quote: "Technical Agents: These agents are tech-savvies, typically tasked with interfacing with technical platforms or development tools"

  - name: "Agent Memory Variability Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 2:24-27)"
    quote: "While some agents harness the power of memory or an action log, e.g., for reflecting or planning tasks, others function devoid of these recollections"
    description: "Agent modeling allows for memory variability - some agents use memory for reflection and planning, while others operate without memory. Memory-less agents are preferred for technical aspects or actions demanding an unbiased lens. This enables modeling agents with different cognitive architectures."

  - name: "Agent Autonomy Levels Model"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 2:303-323)"
    quote: "The degree of autonomy refers to the extent to which an AI system can make decisions and act independently of rules and mechanisms defined by humans"
    description: "Three-level autonomy model for agents: L0 (Static) - agents follow predefined rules with no runtime modification capability; L1 (Adaptive) - agents can adapt behavior within established frameworks; L2 (Self-Organizing) - agents emerge as principal actors capable of self-organization, actively learning and dynamically tailoring operations based on environmental cues."

  - name: "Agent Alignment Levels Model"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 2:409-432)"
    quote: "The levels of alignment, represented on the y-axis in our matrix, measure the degree to which users of the system can influence or adjust the system's behavior"
    description: "Three-level alignment model: L0 (Integrated) - alignment built into system architecture, static and rule-driven; L1 (User-Guided) - users can set/adjust alignment parameters before runtime; L2 (Real-Time Responsive) - system actively solicits user feedback at decision points. Alignment complements rather than opposes autonomy."

    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 1:496-506)"
    quote: "This complexity can be traced back to the triadic interplay and inherent tensions among the primary decision-making entities: human users, LLM-powered agents, and governing mechanisms"
    description: "Agents exist within a triadic relationship: (1) Human users - provide goals and supervision; (2) LLM-powered agents - execute with varying autonomy; (3) Rules and mechanisms - provide governance. Agent modeling must account for tensions between these three poles."

    quote: "Direct collaborations involving two or more agents typically rely on prompt-driven communication sequences or cycles"
    description: "Agents communicate through prompt-driven message exchanges. A DelegateTask action conveys information, places requests, initiates queries, or suggests courses of action. EvaluateResult provides feedback by validating/refuting presented results. This models agent interaction as structured dialogue."

  - name: "Communication Protocol Patterns"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 2:82-92)"
    quote: "Strict finite processes or execution chains with predefined action sequences... Dialogue cycles characterized by alternating DelegateTask and ExecuteTask actions"
    description: "Three communication protocol patterns for agents: (1) Strict finite processes - predefined action sequences with well-defined endpoints; (2) Dialogue cycles - alternating instruction/execution between two agents creating feedback loops; (3) Multi-cycle process frameworks - dynamic interactions between generic agent types."

  - name: "Agent Role and Competency Model"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 1:876)"

    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 3:201-230)"
    quote: "Static Autonomy (L0): This level features a predefined and rule-driven composition... Self-Organizing Autonomy (L2): LLM-powered agents exhibit the ability to autonomously define and generate types"
    description: "Agent generation spans three levels: L0 - predefined rule-driven composition with fixed agent types and roles; L1 - predefined structures with flexibility for agents to adapt, replicate instances, extend competencies; L2 - agents autonomously define types, establish networks, and self-organize based on real-time needs."

  - name: "Domain-Ontology Model for Agent Architecture"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 1:795-798)"
    quote: "Domain-ontology model represented as UML class diagram structuring selected architectural concepts and concept relations relevant for the domain of autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems"

    description: "Three agent system archetypes: (1) General-Purpose Systems (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, SuperAGI, AgentGPT) - adaptable to broad task spectrum with task-management agents; (2) Central LLM Controller (HuggingGPT) - single control agent combining contextual resources; (3) Role-Agent Systems (MetaGPT, CAMEL) - multiple dedicated role agents simulating domain collaboration."

  - name: "Instructor-Executor Agent Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 4:51-67)"
    quote: "This collaboration is realized by communication protocols employing a dynamic exchange between agents with instructor and executor roles"
    description: "Role-agent systems model collaboration through instructor-executor relationships. CAMEL uses AI-user role (instructor) and AI-assistant role (executor) in dialogue cycles. MetaGPT assigns predefined roles alongside waterfall processes. This models division of labor between directing and executing agents."

  - name: "Bounded Autonomy Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 4:74-90)"
    quote: "these high-autonomy aspects are mostly combined with low alignment levels, resulting in bounded autonomy aspects"
    description: "Agents often exhibit 'bounded autonomy' - high autonomy (L2) combined with low alignment (L0). High-autonomy aspects (decomposition, action management, resource utilization) are controlled by low-autonomy aspects (communication protocol, resource integration). Predefined mechanisms serve as integrated alignment for autonomous aspects."

  - name: "Agent Collaboration Adaptability Challenge"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 4:118-139)"
    quote: "Among the systems analyzed, we especially observe limitations regarding collaboration modes and role-playing capabilities, as well as risks tied to prompt-driven collaboration techniques"
    description: "Current agent modeling faces three collaboration challenges: (1) Restricted communication protocols - mainly predefined instructor-executor patterns; (2) Limited dynamic role-playing - potential of multi-perspective collaboration underexplored; (3) Prompt-driven vulnerability - susceptible to LLM errors and hallucinations affecting collaboration quality."

  - name: "Agent Self-Critique and Reflection Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 3:647-665)"
    quote: "The executing agent is performing the assigned tasks autonomously... The agent systematically addresses tasks, prioritizing them based on a predefined list"
    description: "Execution agents in systems like AutoGPT perform self-criticism following task completion, evaluating intermediate results. This models reflexive agency where agents assess their own outputs before proceeding, enabling iterative refinement within autonomous operation."
