patterns:
  - name: "LLM-Driven Process Model to Code Translation"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:12-27)"
    quote: "we present an exploratory study to investigate the use of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions"
    description: "Pattern where LLMs consume formal process model representations (BPMN) and generate executable code (Solidity smart contracts). This represents a form of agent-ontology integration where the LLM reasons over structured ontological process models to produce code that enforces process flow, resource allocation, and data-based conditions. The ontology (BPMN metamodel) constrains and guides the LLM generation."

  - name: "Ontology-Augmented Prompt Engineering"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:306-316)"
    quote: "This encoding is embedded into the prompt, along with the model data, by the LLM provider interface, which calls the external LLM provider"
    description: "Pattern where ontological structures (task IDs, participant IDs, process encodings) are embedded into LLM prompts to guide generation. The simulator generates encodings that map events and participants to structured representations in smart contracts. This shows how ontological metadata becomes part of the agent's context for reasoning."

  - name: "Process Trace Replay for Ontology Conformance Verification"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:238-251)"
    quote: "An established method to benchmark the correctness of a blockchain-based business process is to replay all possible conforming traces (which the smart contract has to accept)"
    description: "Pattern for verifying that LLM-generated code conforms to ontological process specifications. Conforming and non-conforming traces are generated from the process model (ontology) and replayed against generated artifacts. This represents ontology-driven validation of agent outputs, ensuring the agent's work aligns with formal process semantics."

  - name: "Model-Driven Code Generation with LLM Flexibility"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:54-61)"
    quote: "Blockchain-based business process execution relies on a model-driven paradigm, where process descriptions are transformed into executable artefacts based on rule-based transformation tools"
    description: "Integration pattern where traditional rule-based model-to-code transformations are augmented with LLM capabilities. LLMs overcome limitations of rigid rule-based approaches while still operating on ontologically-structured process models. The ontology provides the formal input structure that the LLM transforms."

  - name: "Few-Shot Ontology Translation"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:145-147)"
    quote: "In zero-shot prompting, models complete tasks based solely on instructions without prior examples, whereas few-shot prompting involves providing a handful of illustrative examples"
    description: "Pattern where agents learn ontology-to-code translation through limited examples. One-shot and two-shot prompts with ontological process models guide the LLM to produce correct translations. The examples encode the mapping between ontological concepts (BPMN elements) and their code representations."

  - name: "Ontology as Benchmark for Agent Evaluation"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:546-558)"
    quote: "True Positive: Each event in a conforming trace was accepted (led to a state change in the contract), and the whole trace led to the end event"
    description: "Pattern using ontological specifications to create automated evaluation metrics for agent outputs. Process conformance checking based on ontological trace definitions (True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, False Negative) enables systematic benchmarking of LLM-generated artifacts against formal process specifications."

  - name: "Virtual Agent for Ontology-Based Process Execution Support"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:77-78)"
    quote: "the ontology forms a knowledge base (KB) that will be exploited by a virtual agent to support operators in the execution of BP step-by-step"
    description: "Pattern where an AI virtual agent queries and reasons over an ontology-populated knowledge base to guide human operators through business process execution. The agent uses the BBO ontology to answer questions about process steps, required resources, and execution constraints in real-time."

  - name: "SPARQL Querying for Competency Question Answering"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:524-532)"
    quote: "Table 7 shows examples of how we turned competency questions into SPARQL queries"
    description: "Pattern for agent-ontology integration via SPARQL query generation. Competency questions (natural language) are translated to SPARQL queries against the BBO ontology knowledge base. This enables agents to retrieve structured answers about process resources, task sequences, manufacturing facilities, and resource types from the ontological representation."

  - name: "Ontology-Driven Process Navigation"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:559-561)"
    quote: "SELECT ?nextTask WHERE { BBO:T1 BBO:has_outgoing ?SequenceFlow. ?SequenceFlow BBO:has_targetRef ?nextTask. ?nextTask a BBO:Task}"
    description: "Pattern for agents to navigate process execution paths using ontological relationships. By querying SequenceFlow relationships and FlowNode references, agents can determine task ordering, conditional branches, and execution dependencies. This enables dynamic process guidance based on formal ontology structure."

  - name: "Resource Type Resolution via Ontological Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:531-532)"
    quote: "We have performed queries on the inferred ontology, which explains the three answers to question 4"
    description: "Pattern leveraging ontological reasoning (inference) to resolve resource types and classifications. Queries on the inferred ontology return hierarchical type information (SoftwareResource, Resource, NamedIndividual), enabling agents to reason about resource taxonomy and inheritance relationships defined in BBO."

  - name: "Ontology-Constrained Output Validation"
    chunk_ref: "21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:651-659)"
    quote: "This could involve using LLMs to propose code snippets or modifications, which are then rigorously checked against formal specifications"
    description: "Pattern for responsible AI integration where ontological specifications serve as validation constraints for LLM outputs. LLMs propose code that is verified against formal process specifications using automated theorem provers or benchmarking frameworks. The ontology defines the 'ground truth' for correctness checking."

  - name: "Natural Language to Process Ontology Pipeline"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:581-582)"
    quote: "we need to systematically instantiate BBO with all the process descriptions in the companies' technical documents. We will implement a Natural Language Processing pipeline"
    description: "Pattern for populating ontologies from natural language using NLP/AI pipelines. Technical documents describing business processes are processed to extract ontological assertions that instantiate the BBO knowledge base. This enables automated knowledge base construction from unstructured sources, which agents can then query."
