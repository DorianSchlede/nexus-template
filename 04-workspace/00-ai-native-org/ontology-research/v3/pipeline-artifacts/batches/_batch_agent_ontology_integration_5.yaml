    quote: "Drawing from the domain-ontology model (Fig. 4), we now systematize the viewpoint-specific aspects employed in our taxonomy"
    description: "The taxonomy uses a domain-ontology model as the foundation for systematizing architectural viewpoints in multi-agent systems. This demonstrates how ontological structures can guide the organization and classification of agent architectures, with viewpoints derived from ontological categories."

    description: "The taxonomy provides an ontological framework for classifying agents along two dimensions (autonomy and alignment), creating a two-dimensional matrix that enables nuanced categorization of agent behaviors and system configurations."

  - name: "Agent-Role Ontological Flexibility"
    chunk_ref: "18-Multi-Agent_Architecture_Taxonomy_LLM (Chunk 4:51-60)"
