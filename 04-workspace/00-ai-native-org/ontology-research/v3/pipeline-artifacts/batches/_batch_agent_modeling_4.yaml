patterns:
  - name: "Role-Based Multi-Agent Architecture"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:894-906)"
    quote: "user: An attentive HUMAN user who can answer questions... planner: A planner who can suggest a plan... assistant: An assistant who calls the appropriate tools..."
    description: "The SciAgents system models agents through explicit role assignments. Each agent has a defined identity (user, planner, assistant, ontologist, scientist, etc.) with specific capabilities and responsibilities. This demonstrates role-based agent modeling where agent identity is coupled with functional specialization rather than generic autonomous actors."

  - name: "Specialized Domain Agents"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:897-907)"
    quote: "ontologist: An ontologist who defines each of the terms and discusses the relationships... scientist: A scientist who can craft the research proposal..."
    description: "Agents are modeled with domain-specific expertise. The ontologist agent specializes in term definitions and relationship analysis, while the scientist agent focuses on research proposal crafting. This pattern shows agents modeled as subject matter experts rather than generalist reasoners."

  - name: "Aspect-Expansion Agent Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:899-906)"
    quote: "hypothesis_agent who can expand the 'hypothesis' aspect... outcome_agent who can expand the 'outcome' aspect... mechanism_agent who can expand the 'mechanism' aspect"
    description: "A set of agents are modeled specifically to expand discrete aspects of a research proposal (hypothesis, outcome, mechanism, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, novelty). Each agent operates on a single, well-defined facet, demonstrating fine-grained functional decomposition in agent modeling."

  - name: "Critic Agent as Meta-Level Reviewer"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:906-907)"
    quote: "critic_agent: Summarizes, critiques, and suggests improvements after all seven aspects of the proposal have been expanded by the agents."
    description: "The critic agent operates at a meta-level, reviewing the collective output of other agents. This demonstrates a hierarchical agent modeling pattern where some agents have oversight and evaluation roles rather than direct content generation responsibilities."

  - name: "Human-in-the-Loop Agent Model"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:894-895)"
    quote: "user: An attentive HUMAN user who can answer questions about the task, and can perform tasks such as running Python code or inputting command line commands"
    description: "The human user is modeled as an agent within the multi-agent system with specific capabilities (answering questions, executing code, running terminal commands). This pattern treats humans as first-class participants in the agent architecture with defined interaction protocols."

  - name: "Function-Calling Assistant Pattern"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 3:896)"
    quote: "assistant: An assistant who calls the appropriate tools and functions and returns the results."
    description: "The assistant agent is modeled specifically as a tool orchestrator, responsible for invoking external functions and returning results. This demonstrates agent modeling focused on interface mediation and tool use capabilities as a distinct agent role."

  - name: "Sequential Agent Workflow Model"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 4:9-18)"
    quote: "1. Define Terms and Relationships: The ontologist will define each term... 2. Craft the Research Proposal: The scientist will craft... 3. Expand Key Aspects: Each specialized agent..."
    description: "Agents are modeled to execute in a defined sequential order following a predetermined plan. The workflow explicitly specifies which agent acts at each stage, demonstrating a pipeline-based agent orchestration model rather than autonomous peer-to-peer collaboration."

  - name: "Ontologist as Knowledge Path Interpreter"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 4:89-101)"
    quote: "Silk: A natural protein fiber produced by certain insects... Biological Materials: Substances that are produced by or derived from living organisms..."
    description: "The ontologist agent is modeled to interpret knowledge graph paths and produce structured definitions. It transforms graph relationships into human-readable explanations, demonstrating agents modeled as semantic interpreters bridging structured and natural language representations."

  - name: "Agent-Generated Validation Scoring"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 4:220-223)"
    quote: "Novelty: 9/10 - The integration of biomimicry, nanoscale pigmentation, and low-temperature processing is highly innovative. Feasibility: 8/10"
    description: "Agents produce quantitative assessments and ratings as part of their outputs. This models agents as evaluators capable of producing structured judgments with numeric scores, enabling downstream aggregation and decision-making."

  - name: "Planner Agent for Task Decomposition"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:127-131)"
    quote: "planner: A planner who can suggest a plan to solve the task by breaking down the task into simpler sub-tasks."
    description: "The planner agent is explicitly modeled for task decomposition, suggesting plans by breaking complex tasks into sub-tasks. This demonstrates agent modeling where planning and execution are separated as distinct capabilities assigned to different agent roles."

  - name: "Random Keyword Path Generation for Agent Input"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 5:145-165)"
    quote: "Generate Random Keywords and Knowledge Path: Use the generate_path function to generate a knowledge path between two randomly selected keywords."
    description: "Agents receive structured inputs from knowledge graph queries. The system models agent reasoning as grounded in retrieved knowledge paths, demonstrating agents designed to operate on graph-structured knowledge rather than purely unstructured text."

  - name: "Synthetic Biology Agent for Experimental Design"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 6:101-115)"
    quote: "Question: Can biomimetic materials with a lamellar structure be engineered to exhibit self-healing properties... Key Steps for Synthetic Biology Experiments..."
    description: "Specialized agents are modeled to produce domain-specific experimental protocols and research questions. The synthetic biology agent generates concrete experimental steps (material synthesis, characterization, self-healing assessment, optimization, in vivo testing), demonstrating agents modeled as experimental methodology designers."
