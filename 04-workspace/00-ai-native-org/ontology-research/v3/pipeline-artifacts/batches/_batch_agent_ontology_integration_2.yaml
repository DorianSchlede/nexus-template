patterns:
  - name: "Ontological Knowledge Graph as Agent Context Provider"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:30-34)"
    quote: "SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts"
    description: "The framework integrates ontological knowledge graphs as the foundational substrate for multi-agent reasoning. The knowledge graph organizes and interconnects diverse scientific concepts, providing agents with structured context for hypothesis generation. This demonstrates how agents can interact with ontological structures to guide their reasoning and discovery process."

  - name: "Sub-graph Sampling for Agent Context Injection"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:133-137)"
    quote: "We implemented a novel sampling strategy to extract relevant sub-graphs from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand the key concepts and their interrelationships"
    description: "Agents receive ontological context through sub-graph extraction rather than accessing the entire knowledge graph. This sampling strategy allows agents to work with focused, relevant portions of the ontology, enabling targeted reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency. The sub-graph serves as the agent's contextual knowledge substrate."

  - name: "Ontologist Agent for Concept Relationship Interpretation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:225-227)"
    quote: "Each agent plays a specialized role: The Ontologist defines key concepts and relationships, Scientist 1 crafts a detailed research proposal"
    description: "A dedicated Ontologist agent is responsible for defining concepts and relationships from the knowledge graph, translating ontological structure into actionable knowledge for other agents. This agent serves as the interface between the formal ontology and the reasoning agents, interpreting graph data into meaningful scientific relationships."

  - name: "Path-Based Graph Traversal for Knowledge Discovery"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:239-246)"
    quote: "At the core of our model is an expansive knowledge graph... we provide it with a sub-graph derived from this more extensive knowledge graph. This sub-graph depicts a pathway that connects two crucial concepts or nodes"
    description: "Agents interact with ontologies through path-based traversal, following connections between nodes to discover relationships. The path represents a chain of ontological relationships (concept -- relation -- concept) that guides agent reasoning. Random path sampling infuses richer conceptual diversity compared to shortest-path approaches."

  - name: "Dynamic Knowledge Generation from Static Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:289-296)"
    quote: "the agent helps transition from static knowledge retrieval to dynamic knowledge generation. This crucial shift is what enables the model to identify gaps in existing research and propose new angles of inquiry"
    description: "Agents use ontological structures not just for retrieval but for generative reasoning. The Ontologist agent applies advanced reasoning and inference techniques to synthesize and interpret the complex web of ontological data, extracting insights that are not obvious from the graph structure alone. This transforms static ontology into dynamic hypothesis generation."

  - name: "Multi-Agent Role Specialization for Ontology Processing"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:708-738)"
    quote: "Human: human user... Planner: suggests a detailed plan... Ontologist: responsible to define the relationships and concepts within the knowledge graph. Scientist 1: crafts the initial draft... Critic: conducts a thorough review"
    description: "The multi-agent system assigns specialized roles for processing ontological knowledge. The Ontologist agent specifically handles concept definition and relationship interpretation, while other agents (Planner, Scientists, Critic) build upon this ontological foundation. This demonstrates role-based decomposition of ontology-to-reasoning pipelines."

  - name: "Knowledge Graph Path as Structured Research Context"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:134-138)"
    quote: "We use a large graph generated as part of earlier work... The graph utilized here includes 33,159 nodes and 48,753 edges and represents the giant component of the graph generated from around 1,000 papers"
    description: "The ontological knowledge graph is constructed from scientific literature (1,000 papers) and serves as structured context for agent reasoning. With 33,159 nodes and 48,753 edges organized into 92 communities, this represents a large-scale ontology that agents navigate to generate research hypotheses."

  - name: "Heuristic Pathfinding with Embeddings for Ontology Navigation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:245-260)"
    quote: "The algorithm presented in this work combines heuristic-based pathfinding with node embeddings and randomized waypoints to discover diverse paths in a graph... the embeddings are generated using a pre-trained model"
    description: "Agents navigate ontological graphs using embedding-based heuristics rather than purely symbolic traversal. Node embeddings (using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) enable semantic similarity-based pathfinding, allowing agents to discover conceptually related paths even when explicit ontological links are sparse. This hybrid symbolic-neural approach enhances agent-ontology interaction."

  - name: "Sub-graph Context Expansion for Agent Reasoning"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:256-260)"
    quote: "After the path is found, a subgraph consisting of the path nodes and their second-hop neighbors is generated, providing a broader context for the discovered route"
    description: "Agents receive expanded ontological context beyond the primary path by including second-hop neighbors. This enriches the agent's reasoning substrate with related concepts and relationships, enabling more comprehensive hypothesis generation while maintaining focused relevance to the core research question."

  - name: "JSON Schema-Guided Ontology-to-Output Generation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:305-307)"
    quote: "The output, in JSON format, provides key fields such as mechanisms, unexpected_properties, and comparison, offering a highly detailed analysis"
    description: "Agents translate ontological knowledge into structured JSON outputs following predefined schemas. The schema includes fields for hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty. This demonstrates ontology-guided structured generation where the knowledge graph informs content while the schema constrains output format."

  - name: "Ontology-Guided Hypothesis Generation Pipeline"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:279-307)"
    quote: "the algorithm begins by identifying two key nodes... The graph structure is used not only for identifying the connectivity between the nodes but also for guiding the algorithm's search for the most relevant or exploratory paths"
    description: "The full pipeline shows how agents use ontologies: (1) identify key nodes, (2) generate path through knowledge graph, (3) extract sub-graph context, (4) expand definitions via Ontologist agent, (5) generate structured hypothesis via Scientist agents, (6) critique and refine via Critic agent. This demonstrates end-to-end ontology-guided agent reasoning."

  - name: "Semantic Scholar API for Literature-Based Ontology Validation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 2:505-511)"
    quote: "We use the Semantic Scholar API, an AI-powered search engine for academic resources, to search for related publications using a set of keywords... The novelty assistant agent then thoroughly analyzes the abstracts and provides a review"
    description: "Agents validate ontology-derived hypotheses against external literature databases. The Assistant agent calls Semantic Scholar API to retrieve related publications, and a Novelty Assistant agent analyzes whether the ontology-guided hypothesis is novel relative to existing research. This demonstrates external knowledge source integration for ontology validation."

  - name: "Automated Agent Selection via Group Chat Manager"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:770-773)"
    quote: "The manager selects the working agents to collaborate based on the current chat context, fostering cooperation and enabling mutual adjustments to solve the problem"
    description: "A Group Chat Manager orchestrates which agents engage with ontological data at each step of the reasoning process. The manager dynamically selects agents based on conversation context, enabling adaptive workflow where ontology processing is distributed across specialized agents as needed."

  - name: "Shared Memory for Ontological Context Propagation"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents (Chunk 1:784-788)"
    quote: "the second approach allows agents to share memory, giving them access to all the content generated in previous interactions. This means they operate with full visibility of the history of their collaboration"
    description: "Agents share memory containing ontological context and derived insights. Unlike the first approach where agents receive filtered information, the automated multi-agent system provides full visibility of collaboration history, ensuring ontological definitions and relationships propagate consistently across all agent interactions."
