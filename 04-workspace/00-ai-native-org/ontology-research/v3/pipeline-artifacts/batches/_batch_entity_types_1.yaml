  # FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION: Endurant vs Perdurant
  - name: "Endurant-Perdurant Dichotomy"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-288)"
    quote: "UFO is a 3D ontology having, as a fundamental distinction, the one between endurants and perdurants, as opposed to a 4D ontology in which all concrete individuals are perdurants"
    description: "The most fundamental entity type distinction in UFO. Endurants exist in time with all their parts and can qualitatively change while maintaining identity. Perdurants unfold in time accumulating temporal parts. This maps to the 8-entity hypothesis where Events are perdurants and most other entities (Agent, Resource, Data, Role) are endurants."

  - name: "Endurant Definition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:285-288)"
    quote: "Endurants are individuals that exist in time with all their parts. They have essential and accidental properties and, hence, they can qualitatively change while maintaining their numerical identity"
    description: "Core entity type definition. Endurants can change properties while remaining the same individual. The unique Kind they instantiate defines what changes are permissible. This supports modeling Agents, Resources, Roles as entities that persist through change."

  - name: "Perdurant Definition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:289-296)"
    quote: "Perdurants are individuals that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts. They are manifestations of dispositions and only exist in the past. As such, perdurants are modally fragile"
    description: "Events in the 8-entity hypothesis correspond to perdurants. They cannot change - any apparent change is variation between temporal parts or change in underlying endurants. Events are founded on dispositions inhering in endurants."

  # ENDURANT SUBTYPES
  - name: "Substantial vs Moment Partition"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:297-301)"
    quote: "UFO is an ontology based of the so-called Aristotelian Square, thus, accounting for both substantial individuals (or Substantials), i.e., independent entities, as well as particularized properties, i.e., existentially dependent entities or moments"
    description: "Endurants partition into Substantials (independent, e.g., Mick Jagger, an organization) and Moments (existentially dependent, e.g., a headache, a marriage). This is the Aristotelian Square four-category ontology structure."

  - name: "Object Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:360-361)"
    quote: "Objects (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated functional roles with respect to the whole, e.g, a human body, an organization, a computer"
    description: "Objects are substantials with parts that have distinct functional roles. Maps to Agent (organizations are objects), Resource (computers, tools are objects). Unity comes from functional integration of parts."

  - name: "Collective Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:356-358)"
    quote: "Collectives are entities whose parts play the same role with respect to the whole, e.g., the Black Forest (as a collective of trees), a deck of cards, the Dutch-speaking group"
    description: "Collectives are substantials whose parts are homogeneous in role. Could model teams, groups of agents, resource pools. Distinct from Objects where parts have differentiated roles."

  - name: "Quantity Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:353-354)"
    quote: "Quantities are maximally-topologically-self-connected (e.g., pieces) of homeomerous amounts of matter, e.g., that puddle of water, this particular pile of sand"
    description: "Quantities are substantials representing continuous matter portions. Less relevant for digital work ontology but could model data volumes, resource quantities."

  # MOMENT SUBTYPES (Existentially Dependent Endurants)
  - name: "Intrinsic Moment - Quality"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:302-306)"
    quote: "Intrinsic moments are existentially dependent on a single individual. These include qualities, i.e., reifications of categorical properties such as color, height, weight, electrical charge"
    description: "Qualities are moments that can be projected into value spaces. They represent measurable properties. Could model Data attributes, Resource properties, Agent capabilities as measurable values."

  - name: "Intrinsic Moment - Mode"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-323)"
    quote: "Modes can bear their own moments, including their own qualities, which can vary in independent ways. The category of modes include dispositions (e.g., functions, capabilities, capacities, vulnerabilities)"
    description: "Modes are intrinsic moments that cannot be directly projected to values but can bear other moments. Dispositions are key mode subtype - functions, capabilities map to what Agents and Resources can do."

  - name: "Externally Dependent Mode"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:322-326)"
    quote: "Externally dependent modes inhere in an entity while being externally dependent on another entity. A particularly interesting type of externally dependent mode is a qua individual"
    description: "Modes that depend on entities other than their bearer. Example: John's love for Mary inheres in John but depends on Mary. Models relational properties between entities."

  - name: "Relator Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:329-334)"
    quote: "a relator is a moment (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is an aggregation of qua individuals. For instance, John and Mary's Marriage is composed of John-qua-husband-of-Mary and Mary-qua-wife-of-John"
    description: "Relators are aggregations of qua individuals sharing a foundational event. Examples: marriages, enrollments, employments, contracts, presidential mandates. Critical for modeling relationships between Agents, Roles, and Resources in the 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "Qua Individual"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-328)"
    quote: "a qua individual is a mode composed of other externally dependent modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and the same foundational event"
    description: "Qua individuals aggregate externally dependent modes with common bearer and foundation. John-qua-husband-of-Mary bundles all John's conjugal commitments to Mary from their wedding. Models role-based identity aspects."

  # TYPE SYSTEM - Sortals and Non-Sortals
  - name: "Kind Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:368-369)"
    quote: "a fundamental sort of endurant type is a kind, which provides uniform principles of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances"
    description: "Kinds provide identity criteria - what makes an individual the same over time. Person, dog, computer, car, organization, marriage are kinds. Each endurant instantiates exactly one kind. Foundational for typing Agents, Resources, Roles."

  - name: "Sortal Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:369-372)"
    quote: "A sortal is either a kind or a specialization of a kind, and every sortal that is not a kind specializes exactly one kind. These specializations can be either themselves rigid (subkinds)"
    description: "Sortals carry identity from kinds. Subkinds are rigid sortals (hatchback car subkind of car). Provides taxonomic structure for entity types."

  - name: "Phase Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:373-375)"
    quote: "sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic, termed Phases (e.g., teenager as a phase of person, hemorrhagic dengue fever as a phase of dengue fever)"
    description: "Phases are anti-rigid sortals with intrinsic classification conditions. Entities enter/exit phases based on internal state changes. Could model Task phases (pending, active, completed), Agent states."

  - name: "Role Entity Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:375-377)"
    quote: "sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational, termed roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator, and husband as a role of a person)"
    description: "Roles are anti-rigid sortals with relational classification conditions - entities play roles when in certain relationships. Directly maps to Role in 8-entity hypothesis. Roles depend on relators (employment, marriage)."

  - name: "Category (Non-Sortal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:381-383)"
    quote: "categories: rigid types that define essential properties for their instances, e.g., the category 'physical object' describing the properties of having a mass and a spatial extension"
    description: "Categories are rigid non-sortals abstracting essential properties across kinds. Physical Object applies to cars, persons, bridges. Enables cross-kind generalization."

  - name: "Phase Mixin (Non-Sortal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:385-388)"
    quote: "phase mixins: anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions. For example, 'living animal'"
    description: "Phase mixins abstract intrinsic contingent properties across kinds. Living Animal applies to persons, dogs, horses. Non-sortal version of phases."

  - name: "Role Mixin (Non-Sortal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:390-392)"
    quote: "role mixins: anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their instances. Their instantiation is characterized by relational contingent conditions. Examples include 'customer'"
    description: "Role mixins abstract relational contingent properties across kinds. Customer applies to persons and organizations. Non-sortal version of roles."

  - name: "Mixin (Semi-Rigid Non-Sortal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:394-395)"
    quote: "mixins: semi-rigid types that define properties that are essential to some of their instances but accidental to some other instances (e.g., being a 'music artist' is essential to bands but accidental to people)"
    description: "Mixins have properties essential to some instances, accidental to others. Music artist essential to bands, accidental to people. Captures cross-kind type variation."

  # UFO STRUCTURE (Three Fragments)
  - name: "UFO-A: Endurant Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:273)"
    quote: "UFO-A, which is an ontology of endurants"
    description: "First fragment of UFO covering all endurant types - substantials, moments, qualities, modes, relators. Foundation for modeling persistent entities."

  - name: "UFO-B: Perdurant Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:275)"
    quote: "UFO-B, which is an ontology of perdurants"
    description: "Second fragment covering events, processes, temporal entities. Foundation for modeling Events in the 8-entity hypothesis."

  - name: "UFO-C: Social and Intentional Ontology"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:277-279)"
    quote: "UFO-C, which is an ontology of social and intentional entities build on the foundations provided by the other two"
    description: "Third fragment building on UFO-A and UFO-B for social reality - agents, goals, commitments. Critical for Agent modeling in the 8-entity hypothesis."

  # FORMALIZATION - Types and Individuals
  - name: "Type Definition (Formal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:454)"
    quote: "types are implicitly defined as those entities that are possibly instantiated (a1)"
    description: "Formal definition: Type(x) iff possibly exists y such that y instantiates x. Types are patterns that can have instances."

  - name: "Individual Definition (Formal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:462-463)"
    quote: "Individual(x) iff necessarily not exists y such that y instantiates x"
    description: "Formal definition: Individuals cannot have instances. The domain partitions into types and individuals."

  - name: "Concrete vs Abstract Individual"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:507-509)"
    quote: "Among the individuals, there are concrete individuals and abstract individuals. Concrete individuals are further differentiated into endurants and perdurants"
    description: "Individuals split into concrete (endurants, perdurants) and abstract (sets, quales). Abstract individuals include quality structures."

  - name: "EndurantType and PerdurantType"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:541-542)"
    quote: "types are classified into types of endurants and types of perdurants, which are both disjoint"
    description: "Type-level distinction mirrors individual distinction. EndurantTypes have only endurant instances, PerdurantTypes have only perdurant instances."

  # RIGIDITY METAPROPERTIES
  - name: "Rigid Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:557-558)"
    quote: "rigidity of endurant types as rigid, anti-rigid and semi-rigid"
    description: "Rigidity classifies how necessarily types apply. Rigid types apply necessarily to instances. Anti-rigid types apply contingently. Semi-rigid types are neither."

  - name: "Anti-Rigid Type"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:564)"
    quote: "AntiRigid(t) iff EndurantType(t) and for all x, if possibly x instantiates t then possibly x does not instantiate t"
    description: "Anti-rigid types classify contingently - instances can cease instantiating them. Phases, roles, phase mixins, role mixins are anti-rigid."

  # ENDURANT TAXONOMY (Formal)
  - name: "Substantial-Moment Partition (Formal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:702-703)"
    quote: "Endurant is partitioned into Substantial and Moment. Additionally, Substantial is partitioned into Object, Collective and Quantity"
    description: "Formal taxonomy: Endurant = Substantial + Moment. Substantial = Object + Collective + Quantity. Complete and disjoint partition."

  - name: "Moment Partition (Formal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:709-712)"
    quote: "Moment is partitioned into Relator and IntrinsicMoment. Finally, IntrinsicMoment is partitioned into Mode and Quality"
    description: "Formal taxonomy: Moment = Relator + IntrinsicMoment. IntrinsicMoment = Mode + Quality. Six leaf endurant categories: Object, Collective, Quantity, Relator, Mode, Quality."

  # MEREOLOGY AND COMPOSITION
  - name: "Parthood Relations"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:874-888)"
    quote: "we formalize general extensional mereology. reflexivity, anti-symmetry, transitivity, Overlap, Strong supplementation, Proper Part"
    description: "UFO includes formal mereology for part-whole relations. Supports modeling complex entities composed of parts - organizations from departments, tasks from subtasks."

  - name: "ComponentOf Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 1:909-912)"
    quote: "We can now introduce the notion of component of... componentOf(x, x', y, y') iff x proper-part-of y and individual-functional-dependence(x, x', y, y')"
    description: "ComponentOf combines parthood with functional dependence. Parts function in roles relative to wholes. Enables functional decomposition of complex entities."

  - name: "Constitution Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:18-22)"
    quote: "constitution is a relation that holds between things of the same ontological category... However, following Baker (2007), constitution holds between things of different Kinds"
    description: "Constitution relates entities of same category but different kinds. A statue is constituted by clay - same category (endurant) but different kinds. Not identity - different lifecycle, modal properties."

  # MOMENTS AND INHERENCE (Chunk 2)
  - name: "Inherence Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:137-139)"
    quote: "The relation that connects moments to the object that they are about is the relation of inherence. Inherence is a type of existential dependence relation holding between a moment and an entity"
    description: "Inherence ties moments to bearers. Non-reflexive, asymmetric, anti-transitive. A quality inheres in exactly one bearer. Foundational for modeling properties of Agents, Resources."

  - name: "Externally Dependent Mode (Formal)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:189-196)"
    quote: "a mode x that is existentially dependent on an entity that is independent of the bearer of x... ExternallyDependentMode(x) iff Mode(x) and exists y such that externallyDependent(x, y)"
    description: "Formal definition of externally dependent modes. John's commitment to Mary depends on Mary who is independent of John. Captures relational aspects of entities."

  - name: "Foundational Event"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:207-210)"
    quote: "Externally dependent modes (as well as relators) are founded by means of a unique event. E.g., John's conjugal commitments towards Mary are founded on the event of the wedding"
    description: "Externally dependent modes and relators have a unique foundational event. The wedding founds the marriage relator. Links Events to Roles and relationships."

  - name: "Relator (Formal Definition)"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:247-264)"
    quote: "relators are sums of qua individuals that share the same foundation and are existentially dependent on each other"
    description: "Formal relator definition: aggregation of mutually dependent qua individuals with common foundational event. Relators mediate at least two distinct individuals."

  - name: "Mediation Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:279-280)"
    quote: "We introduce the relation of mediation, mediates(x, y), between a relator x and an individual y that the relator connects in a relational statement"
    description: "Mediation links relators to the individuals they connect. A marriage relator mediates husband and wife. Critical for modeling Role-based relationships."

  # QUALITIES AND QUALITY STRUCTURES
  - name: "Quality Structure"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:349-357)"
    quote: "A quality structure is defined as an entity associated with a unique quality type. quality structures are non-empty sets. The members of quality structures are quales"
    description: "Quality structures define value spaces for quality types. Contains quales (singular values). Partitions into quality dimensions (one-dimensional) and quality domains (multi-dimensional)."

    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:351-352)"
    quote: "A quality structure is partitioned into quality dimension and quality domain"
    description: "Quality dimensions are one-dimensional (height, weight). Quality domains combine dimensions (color as hue+saturation+brightness). Structures measurable properties."

  - name: "HasValue Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:386-388)"
    quote: "The hasValue relation holds from qualities to quales, where hasValue is functional"
    description: "Each quality has exactly one value (quale) at a time. Values come from associated quality structure. Enables property change while maintaining quality identity."

  # ENDURANT-PERDURANT CONNECTION
  - name: "Manifestation Relation"
    chunk_ref: "01-UFO (Chunk 2:505-507)"
    quote: "Any endurant is connected to a perdurant by the manifestation relation... The life of an endurant is then specified by a functional relation that associates the endurant with the mereological sum of all events"
    description: "Manifestation links endurants to their events. The life of an endurant is the sum of all events manifesting it. Connects Agents to their Events/Activities."
