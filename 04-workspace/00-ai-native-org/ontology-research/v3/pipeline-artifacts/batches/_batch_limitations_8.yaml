    chunk_ref: "19-Graph_of_Thoughts_LLM_Reasoning (Chunk 1:59-61)"
    quote: "the ToT approaches still fundamentally limit the reasoning abilities within a prompt by imposing the rigid tree structure on the thought process"
    description: "Tree of Thoughts approaches impose a rigid tree structure that fundamentally limits LLM reasoning capabilities. This architectural constraint prevents more flexible, graph-based thought patterns that could enable backtracking and merging of reasoning paths."
