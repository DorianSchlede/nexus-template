  # ============================================================

  - name: "is_a Subtype Relation"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:104-106)"
    quote: "the most important (illustrated in Figure 1) are is_a (abbreviating 'is a subtype of') and part_of"
    description: "BFO uses is_a as the primary hierarchical relationship between types/universals. When two nodes are joined by is_a, it represents that all instances of the first type are also instances of the second type. This is a fundamental structural relationship in ontology graphs."

  - name: "part_of Mereological Relation"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:135-147)"
    quote: "When two nodes are joined together by the part_of relation... this represents an assertion to the effect that every instance of the first type is a part of some instance of the second type"
    description: "BFO's part_of relation holds between instances at the particular level, representing mereological composition. Distinguished between types and instances - the type-level relation implies an instance-level parthood relation."

  - name: "Continuant-Occurrent Categorical Division"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:430-440)"
    quote: "The distinction between continuants and occurrents is for BFO categorical. All the parts of continuants are continuants, and any whole to which a continuant belongs is also a continuant"
    description: "BFO enforces strict categorical separation between continuants (3D entities existing wholly at any time) and occurrents (4D entities that unfold in time). Parthood relations are constrained within each category - no cross-category parts allowed."

  - name: "Participation Relation (Continuant-Occurrent Bridge)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:437-440)"
    quote: "Certainly there are manifold connections between continuants and occurrents, but they are secured in BFO not through parthood relations, but rather through relations of participation"
    description: "BFO uses participation as the key relation connecting continuants and occurrents. Continuants participate in occurrents - this bridges the categorical divide without violating the parthood constraint."

  - name: "Bearer-Quality Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:498-500)"
    quote: "They are entities which are dependent on the independent continuant entities (such as molecules, organisms, planets) which are their bearers"
    description: "Qualities in BFO are specifically dependent on their bearers (independent continuants). This dependence relationship is fundamental - qualities cannot exist without their bearers."

  - name: "Determinable-Determinate Quality Hierarchy"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:500-502)"
    quote: "Qualities instantiate quality universals, which are divided into determinable (such as temperature, length and mass) and determinate (such as 37.0C temperature, 1.6 meter length)"
    description: "Quality universals are organized in a determinable-determinate hierarchy. Determinable universals (like temperature) are rigid - if exemplified at any time, exemplified at every time the bearer exists. Determinates are specific values under determinables."

  - name: "Process-Participant Specific Dependence"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:847-852)"
    quote: "Processes themselves stand to the independent continuants which are their participants in a relation that is analogous to that in which qualities stand to the independent continuants which are their bearers. In both cases we have to deal with the relation of what BFO calls specific dependence"
    description: "Processes are specifically dependent on their participants (independent continuants). This is analogous to quality-bearer dependence but in the occurrent realm. Processes depend on participants for existence."

  - name: "Temporal Part Relation"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:574-593)"
    quote: "a temporal_part_of b =Def. a occurrent_part_of b & for some temporal region r (a spans r..."
    description: "BFO defines temporal parthood for occurrents as a restriction of occurrent parthood to a temporal region. First quarter of a game is temporal part of whole game. Distinguished from mere occurrent parts that don't fill entire temporal slice."

  - name: "Occupies Relation (Process-Spatiotemporal Region)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:549-552)"
    quote: "BFO uses 'occupies' to refer to the relation that holds between an occurrent and the spatiotemporal region which it exactly fills"
    description: "Processes occupy spatiotemporal regions - the occupies relation links occurrents to their spatiotemporal extension. This is distinct from continuants which exist at spatial regions at times."

  - name: "Spans Relation (Process-Temporal Region)"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:549-563)"
    quote: "Processes and process boundaries occupy spatiotemporal regions and they span temporal intervals and temporal instants, respectively"
    description: "Processes span temporal intervals while process boundaries span temporal instants. The spans relation connects occurrents to their temporal projections."

  - name: "Instance-Universal Instantiation"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 1:789-801)"
    quote: "motion p instance_of universal motion with speed v... where the universal motion with speed v is a specification of the universal motion"
    description: "BFO uses instantiation as the relation between particulars and their universals. Process attributions are treated in terms of instantiation rather than qualities - a motion instantiates the universal 'motion with speed v'."

  - name: "Process Profile Comparison Dimension"
    chunk_ref: "07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:119-125)"
    quote: "When comparing two heart beating processes as being for example of the same rate... there is something in each of the two processes which is not numerically but qualitatively 'the same'. This something which the two processes share in common we shall refer to as a process profile"
    description: "Process profiles are shareable aspects of processes along specific dimensions of comparison (rate, speed, etc.). Two processes can share the same process profile universal even though numerically distinct."

  # Paper 09: OCEL 2.0 Specification
  # ============================================================

  - name: "Event-to-Object (E2O) Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:178-185)"
    quote: "Event-to-Object (E2O) Relationships: Events are associated with objects. This relationship describes that an object affects an event or that an event affects an object... events can be related to multiple objects"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 defines E2O as many-to-many relationships between events and objects. Unlike traditional logs where events relate to single cases, E2O allows events to relate to multiple objects of different types. Relationships can be qualified to describe the role an object plays."

  - name: "Object-to-Object (O2O) Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:191-194)"
    quote: "Object-to-Object (O2O) Relationships: Objects can also be related to other objects outside the context of an event. For example, an employee may be part of an organizational unit"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 introduces O2O relationships to capture structural relationships between objects independent of events. These can be qualified with relationship types like part-of, reports-to, or belongs-to."

  - name: "Event Type Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:408)"
    quote: "evtype: E -> U_etype assigns types to events"

  - name: "Object Type Assignment"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:424)"
    quote: "objtype: O -> U_otype assigns types to objects"
    description: "Every object is assigned exactly one object type via the objtype function. This is a many-to-one relationship from objects to object types."

  - name: "Qualified E2O Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:306-308)"
    quote: "E2O relationship qualifiers describe in which role an object takes part in an event, while O2O relationship qualifiers can further characterize the association between two objects"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 enriches relationships with qualifiers. E2O qualifiers describe object roles in events (e.g., organizer vs participant). O2O qualifiers characterize object associations (e.g., part-of, reports-to)."

  - name: "Event Attribute Type Mapping"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:416-417)"
    quote: "eatype: EA -> U_etype assigns event types to event attributes"
    description: "Event attributes are scoped to specific event types via eatype function. An attribute is only valid for events of the corresponding type, ensuring type-consistent attribute assignments."

  - name: "Object Attribute Type Mapping"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:430)"
    quote: "oatype: OA -> U_otype assigns object types to object attributes"
    description: "Object attributes are scoped to specific object types via oatype function. This ensures attributes are only assigned to objects of appropriate types."

  - name: "Dynamic Object Attribute Values (Temporal)"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:293-297)"
    quote: "OCEL 2.0 adopts a dynamic approach where attribute values can change over time. Instead of having a single, fixed value, an object attribute may have a value that changes during the process"
    description: "OCEL 2.0 introduces temporal relationships for object attributes - attribute values are indexed by time, allowing tracking of object state changes throughout process execution."

  - name: "Foreign Key Event-Object Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 2:276-283)"
    quote: "The event_object table contains the event-to-object relationships (E2O in Definition 2). Therefore, it contains the correlated event identifier and object identifier (foreign key to event.ocel_id and object.ocel_id respectively) with a qualifier"
    description: "In relational implementation, E2O relationships are captured via a junction table with foreign keys to both event and object tables plus a qualifier column. Primary key spans all three columns to prevent duplicates."

  - name: "Foreign Key Object-Object Relationship"
    chunk_ref: "09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 2:319-325)"
    quote: "The object_object table contains the object-to-object relationships (O2O in Definition 2). Therefore, it contains the correlated object identifiers (source and target; both are foreign keys to object.ocel_id) with a qualifier"
    description: "O2O relationships stored in junction table with source and target object foreign keys plus qualifier. Same object pair can have multiple qualified relationships."

    chunk_ref: "10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:781)"
    quote: "F subset of N x OT x N is a set of typed arcs"
    description: "OC-DFG edges are typed by object type. An arc (n1, ot, n2) indicates activities n1 and n2 are directly-follows for object type ot. Enables multi-perspective process models."
