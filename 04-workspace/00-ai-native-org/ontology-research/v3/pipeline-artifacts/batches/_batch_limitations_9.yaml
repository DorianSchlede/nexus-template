patterns:
  - name: "Single Dataset Validation Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:595-598)"
    quote: "Despite the demonstration and application of the framework, it is tested only with one data set and process. The evaluation has shown that not all criteria can be tested against this data set"
    description: "The RPA viability assessment framework was only validated against a single P2P process dataset. Authors acknowledge this limits generalizability and the framework must be validated through application to multiple and different kinds of processes."

  - name: "Missing Event Log Attributes Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:562-565)"
    quote: "First, missing attributes such as starting timestamps in the event log impede the possibility to assess typically easy to evaluate criteria like the execution time or execution urgency"
    description: "Event logs often lack essential attributes needed for RPA assessment. Missing starting timestamps prevent evaluation of execution time and urgency criteria, limiting the framework's applicability to incomplete data."

  - name: "Exception Source Indistinguishability"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:564-566)"
    quote: "the possible lack of information about exceptions in the event log inhibits the ability to distinguish between a system-related stability or human error caused issue"
    description: "Event logs may not contain information needed to differentiate between system stability issues and human errors. This prevents accurate assessment of failure causes and appropriate automation decisions."

  - name: "Missing User Interface Interaction Data"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:566-572)"
    quote: "crucial information about the interaction on the user interface is missing and prevents the examination of the criteria determinism, structuredness of data, interfaces and number of systems"
    description: "Event logs typically capture back-end events but not front-end user interactions. This gap prevents assessment of determinism (whether tasks follow rule-based logic), data structuredness, interface complexity, and system count. Authors suggest user interaction loggers could bridge this gap."

  - name: "Determinism Cannot Be Evaluated From Event Logs"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:497-500)"
    quote: "The event log does not include information about the performance of the activity 'Change Quantity' on the presentation layer. Therefore, the criterion can not be evaluated for this data set"
    description: "Determinism is a distinctive criterion for RPA viability that requires understanding presentation layer interactions. Standard event logs lack this information, making it impossible to assess whether tasks follow rule-based, deterministic flows suitable for automation."

  - name: "Anonymized Data Limiting Evaluation"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:605-608)"
    quote: "Another important aspect is that the data set was anonymized and modified before publishing, limiting the accessible information stored in the event logs"
    description: "Data anonymization required for public datasets reduces the information available for comprehensive framework evaluation. This is a practical limitation when validating assessment frameworks against real-world data."

  - name: "Qualitative Criteria Not Testable With Process Mining"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:598-601)"
    quote: "the framework contains qualitative criteria that could not be tested with the data set. Further evaluation of these criteria - e.g. through case studies - is necessary"
    description: "Some RPA viability criteria are qualitative and cannot be assessed through process mining alone. These require alternative evaluation methods such as case studies or expert interviews."

  - name: "Cognitive Task Assessment Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:106-107)"
    quote: "Although RPA typically favors less complex and cognitive tasks, advances in machine learning can extend the range of RPA application in the future"
    description: "Current RPA technology cannot handle tasks requiring cognitive assessment or subjective judgment. The framework acknowledges this inherent limitation of RPA, noting machine learning advances may eventually address this gap."

  - name: "Subjective Judgment Exclusion"
    chunk_ref: "22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:127-129)"
    quote: "No or low subjective judgment or interpretation skills are required for decision making as the process follows a rule-based flow"
    description: "RPA is limited to rule-based processes and cannot handle activities requiring subjective interpretation or judgment. This is a fundamental constraint defining the boundary of what can be automated with RPA."

  - name: "BWW Ontology Inadequate for Conceptual Modeling"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:112-121)"
    quote: "Bunge's objective was doing philosophy of science and, being a physicist, chiefly, philosophy of the hard sciences. Conceptual Modeling, in contrast, is about representing aspects of the physical and social world"
    description: "The Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) ontology was designed for philosophy of hard sciences, not conceptual modeling. It fails to account for human cognition, linguistic competence, and descriptive metaphysics needed for conceptual modeling, leading to predictions that conflict with modeler intuitions."

  - name: "BWW Relationship Modeling Constraint"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:121-125)"
    quote: "the BWW dictum that 'mutual properties (or relations) should never be modeled as classes as they should not be allowed to have properties' was in conflict with modeling predictions made by other foundational theories"
    description: "BWW ontology prohibits reified relationships (modeling relations as classes with properties), but this conflicts with practitioner intuitions and other theories. Recorded modeling sessions showed practitioners frequently model reified relationships, exposing BWW's limitations."

  - name: "DOLCE Lacks Universal Categories"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:156-158)"
    quote: "In that respect, GFO's theory of universals still does not recognize these notions and DOLCE does not include universal as a category (DOLCE was designed as an ontology of particulars)"
    description: "DOLCE foundational ontology does not include universals as a category - it was designed only for particulars. This limits its utility for conceptual modeling which requires both entity types (universals) and their instances (particulars)."

  - name: "GFO Bradley Regress Problem"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:158-160)"
    quote: "the GFO theory of relations is subject to the so-called Bradley Regress and, hence, it can only be instantiated by infinite (logical) models. This feature makes it unsuitable for conceptual modeling applications"
    description: "GFO (General Formalized Ontology) has a theory of relations that leads to infinite logical models due to Bradley Regress. This philosophical problem makes GFO unsuitable for practical conceptual modeling applications."

  - name: "OntoUML Limited to Structural/Endurant Modeling"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:353-358)"
    quote: "the language was created to represent structural conceptual models expressing endurantistic aspects of reality. However, systematically, a number of authors...started to produce OntoUML models in which perdurants would appear"
    description: "OntoUML was designed for structural conceptual modeling (endurants only), not temporal/process aspects (perdurants). Users systematically subverted the language to represent events and processes, revealing a limitation that requires extending the metamodel with UFO-B."

  - name: "Diagram Complexity Management Gap"
    chunk_ref: "23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:361-364)"
    quote: "given that the introduction of this new perspective substantially increases the complexity of the resulting diagrams, new complexity management theories and tools for OntoUML diagrams need to be developed"
    description: "Adding perdurant (event/process) modeling to OntoUML substantially increases diagram complexity. Current tools lack adequate support for filtering, modularization, and viewpoint selection needed to manage this complexity."

  - name: "BPMN Lacks Resource Specification"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:83-88)"
    quote: "In spite of its industrial maturity, BPMN does not support the representation of some process specifications such as the material resources required to carry out a given task, or the workstation where a given task should be performed"
    description: "BPMN 2.0, despite being the industry standard for business process modeling, cannot specify material resources required for tasks or physical locations where tasks are performed. BBO ontology was created to address these gaps."

  - name: "BPMN Resource Semantics Ambiguity"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:290-294)"
    quote: "The Resource concept exists in the BPMN meta-model. However, its semantics and definition are ambiguous. Indeed, on p. 95 of BPMN specification, the Resource class is supposed to cover all resource types. However, the definition of the relation that assigns resources...limits the set of resources to the agents"
    description: "BPMN has conflicting definitions of Resource - one suggests all resource types, another limits it to agents performing work. This semantic ambiguity required BBO to explicitly define a resource taxonomy covering all resource types."

  - name: "BPMN Natural Language Specifications Not Machine Processable"
    chunk_ref: "31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:398-404)"
    quote: "the diagrams and XML schema do not reflect the whole specification and miss a part of its semantics...a large part of the specifications is in natural language. Therefore, we have tried to manually conceptualize the natural language specifications"
    description: "BPMN 2.0 specification has substantial semantic content only expressed in natural language text, not captured in UML diagrams or XML schemas. This prevents automated consistency checking and required manual formalization effort in BBO."
