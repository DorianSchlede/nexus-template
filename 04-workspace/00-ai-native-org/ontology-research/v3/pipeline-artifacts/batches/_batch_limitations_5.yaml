  # Paper 12 - Foundations of Process Event Data

  - name: "Case ID Not Always Available"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:76-85)"
    quote: "Case IDs are not always straightforwardly available. This problem has been addressed in both process mining literature, as well as in practice, and is often referred to as event correlation"
    description: "Process mining requires Case IDs to correlate events, but in practice, Case IDs are often missing or not directly available in source systems. This is especially problematic in event streams where the notion of CaseID is even more complicated. This represents a fundamental data availability limitation for process mining applications."

  - name: "Granularity Mismatch Problem"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:103-109)"
    quote: "natural log data is stored at lower levels of granularity than desired for analysis purposes. Typically, one would prefer that the granularity level of activities is such that they can be understood"
    description: "Event data is often logged at much finer granularity than what is useful for business process analysis. The data needs abstraction to bring it to a business-understandable level, requiring additional event abstraction techniques. This granularity mismatch limits direct applicability of process mining."

  - name: "IoT Granularity Gap Challenge"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:317-322)"
    quote: "Sensors and actuators have been deployed widely for all kinds of purposes. Although the granularity gap between typical IoT data (sensor readings) and event data is sometimes challenging to bridge"
    description: "IoT sensor data operates at a fundamentally different granularity level than process events. The gap between raw sensor readings and meaningful business activities is often difficult to bridge, limiting IoT data's direct use in process mining despite its high availability."

  - name: "IID Assumption Violation"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:364-369)"
    quote: "The typical data format of event logs, consisting of events pertaining to cases, make that the rows in event log are intrinsically correlated. This invalidates the assumption of data being independent and identically distributed (IID)"
    description: "Event log data fundamentally violates the IID assumption that underpins most machine learning techniques. Events are by definition correlated within cases, which means standard data science techniques for cleaning and feature transformation cannot be directly applied to event data."

  - name: "Data Quality as Primary Limitation"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:529-535)"
    quote: "Garbage in, garbage out. It is by far the most mentioned quote in data science and far beyond. In process mining, while the problem has been acknowledged in both scientific literature and in practice"
    description: "Data quality remains the most critical limitation in process mining. Despite widespread acknowledgment of the problem, there is still a need for comprehensive frameworks to address bad quality data leading to incorrect analysis results."

  - name: "Four Data Quality Dimensions"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:549-552)"
    quote: "four broad data quality dimensions are identified for event logs: missing data, incorrect data, imprecise data and irrelevant data. Among these four dimensions, incorrect data and imprecise data"
    description: "Event logs suffer from four fundamental data quality issues: missing data, incorrect data, imprecise data, and irrelevant data. Incorrect and imprecise data for key attributes like activity labels and timestamps can have significant consequences for all process mining techniques."

  - name: "Preprocessing Dominates Project Time"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:576-578)"
    quote: "The data pre-processing task is recognized to be one of the most time-consuming aspects of a process mining study with many spending 60-80% of their efforts while some spending up to 90%"
    description: "Data preprocessing consumes 60-90% of total project effort in process mining studies. This extreme overhead limits the practical scalability and adoption of process mining approaches, as most resources go to data preparation rather than analysis."

  - name: "Algorithms Ignore Data Quality"
    chunk_ref: "12-Foundations_of_Process_Event_Data (Chunk 1:599-602)"
    quote: "most of the existing process mining algorithms do not explicitly take the potential presence of data quality issues. The algorithms also typically treat an event log as the whole truth without considering"
    description: "Process mining algorithms typically do not account for data quality issues and treat event logs as ground truth. This can lead to misleading or inaccurate conclusions about processes, as the algorithms are not designed to handle imperfect data."

  # Paper 15 - SciAgents Multi-Agent Graph Reasoning

  - name: "Fabrication Process Complexity"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 2:62-64)"
    quote: "weaknesses include the complexity of the fabrication process, a lack of preliminary data, and concerns about long-term biocompatibility"
    description: "Complex multi-step fabrication processes identified as weakness in research proposals. The complexity limits reproducibility and scalability, and lack of preliminary data makes feasibility uncertain. Long-term validation remains a gap."

  - name: "Foundation Model Capability Dependency"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 2:152-154)"
    quote: "These types of results are expected to improve as more powerful foundation models become available, especially with better long-term planning and reasoning capabilities"
    description: "Multi-agent scientific discovery systems are fundamentally limited by the capabilities of underlying foundation models. Current models have limitations in long-term planning and reasoning that constrain the sophistication of generated research hypotheses."

  - name: "Complexity of Uniform Functionalization"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 4:911-913)"
    quote: "The process of uniformly functionalizing silk with nanoscale pigments may be challenging and requires precise control over the concentration and distribution of pigments"
    description: "Achieving uniform distribution of functional elements at nanoscale requires precise control that is technically challenging. This limits the practical implementation of proposed biomimetic material designs."

  - name: "Scalability Issues in Production"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 4:914-915)"
    quote: "The proposed methods, such as electrospinning and freeze-drying, may face scalability issues when transitioning from laboratory to industrial production"
    description: "Laboratory fabrication techniques like electrospinning and freeze-drying face significant scalability challenges when transitioning to industrial production. This gap between lab-scale and production-scale limits practical application of novel materials."

  - name: "Validation of Predicted Properties"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 4:915-918)"
    quote: "While the proposal suggests potential self-healing and adaptive optical properties, these need to be rigorously tested and validated, which may require additional time and resources"
    description: "AI-generated research hypotheses predict novel properties like self-healing and adaptive behavior, but these predictions require rigorous experimental validation. The gap between predicted and validated properties represents a significant limitation in AI-driven scientific discovery."

  - name: "Novelty Assessment Subjectivity"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 4:985-986)"
    quote: "Novelty: 7/10"
    description: "The novelty assessment of AI-generated research ideas is inherently subjective and depends on the completeness of literature coverage. A score of 7/10 indicates that while novel combinations exist, core concepts are already well-documented in literature, limiting true innovation."

  - name: "Complex Fabrication Reproducibility"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 5:14-17)"
    quote: "Complexity of Functionalization: The process of uniformly functionalizing silk with nanoscale pigments may be challenging and requires precise control over the concentration and distribution"
    description: "Complex fabrication processes requiring precise control over nanoscale distributions present reproducibility challenges. This limits the ability to consistently produce materials with predicted properties across different laboratories."

  - name: "Scalability for Industrial Production"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 5:17-18)"
    quote: "Scalability: The proposed methods, such as electrospinning and freeze-drying, may face scalability issues when transitioning from laboratory to industrial production"
    description: "Laboratory fabrication methods often cannot scale to industrial production without significant process modifications. This scalability limitation constrains the practical impact of research discoveries."

  - name: "Lack of Preliminary Data"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 5:969-970)"
    quote: "Limited Preliminary Data: The proposal lacks preliminary data to support the feasibility of achieving the proposed improvements in heat transfer and mechanical stability"
    description: "AI-generated research proposals often lack preliminary experimental data to validate feasibility claims. This represents a fundamental limitation in AI-driven hypothesis generation, as predictions remain theoretical until experimentally validated."

  - name: "Long-term Biocompatibility Unknowns"
    chunk_ref: "15-SciAgents_Multi-Agent_Graph_Reasoning (Chunk 5:970-973)"
    quote: "Potential Biocompatibility Issues: While the proposal emphasizes biocompatibility, it does not address potential issues related to long-term implantation and interaction with biological tissues"
    description: "Short-term biocompatibility testing may not reveal long-term issues in biological applications. The gap between initial biocompatibility assessment and long-term performance represents a significant limitation for biomedical material applications."
