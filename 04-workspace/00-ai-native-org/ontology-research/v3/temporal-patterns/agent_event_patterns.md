## Executive Summary

This document catalogs patterns for how agents participate in events, derived from foundational ontologies (UFO, DOLCE, BFO), provenance standards (PROV-O, PROV-AGENT), process mining research (Event Knowledge Graphs), and agentic AI frameworks (Multi-Agent Taxonomy, Agentic RAG). These patterns inform the UDWO metamodel's agent-activity relationships.

## 1. Foundational Participation Model

### 1.1 Core Participation Relation (DOLCE/UFO)

The fundamental relation connecting agents (as endurants) to events (as perdurants).

```
PC(agent, event, time) → Endurant(agent) ∧ Perdurant(event) ∧ Time(time)
                       ∧ present(agent, time) ∧ present(event, time)
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Temporal indexing**: Participation happens at specific times
- **Mutual presence**: Both agent and event must be present at that time
- **Mandatory participants**: Every event requires at least one participant

### 1.2 Constant Participation (DOLCE)

Agent participates throughout entire event duration.

```
PCC(agent, event) ≡ ∃t(present(event, t)) ∧ ∀t(present(event, t) → PC(agent, event, t))
```

**Use Cases**:
- Task executor throughout task lifetime
- Meeting organizer for entire meeting
- Process owner for entire process instance

### 1.3 Participation via Disposition (UFO)

Agents participate in events through the manifestation of their dispositions.

```
participates(agent, event) ↔ ∃disposition(
  inheres(disposition, agent) ∧
  manifests(event, disposition)
)
```

**Disposition Types**:
- **Functions**: Intended behaviors (e.g., "can perform review")
- **Capabilities**: Acquired abilities (e.g., "can write code")
- **Capacities**: Innate abilities (e.g., "can reason")

## 2. PROV-O Agent Participation Patterns

### 2.1 Association Pattern

Agent responsible for activity.

```
┌─────────┐   wasAssociatedWith   ┌─────────┐
│ Activity│◄──────────────────────│  Agent  │
└─────────┘                       └─────────┘
```

**YAML Specification**:
```yaml
pattern: association
relation: wasAssociatedWith
domain: Activity
range: Agent
semantics: "Agent had responsibility for the Activity"
cardinality: "Activity may have 0..* associated Agents"
inverse: "Agent participates in 0..* Activities"
source: "PROV-O, PROV-AGENT"
```

### 2.2 Attribution Pattern

Entity created by agent.

```
┌─────────┐   wasAttributedTo     ┌─────────┐
│ Entity  │──────────────────────►│  Agent  │
└─────────┘                       └─────────┘
```

**YAML Specification**:
```yaml
pattern: attribution
relation: wasAttributedTo
domain: Entity
range: Agent
semantics: "Entity was produced by or attributed to Agent"
cardinality: "Entity attributed to 0..1 Agent (primary)"
use_cases:
  - "Document authored by"
  - "Decision made by"
  - "Response generated by"
source: "PROV-O, PROV-AGENT"
```

### 2.3 Delegation Pattern

Agent acted on behalf of another.

```
┌─────────┐   actedOnBehalfOf     ┌─────────┐
│ Agent 1 │──────────────────────►│ Agent 2 │
└─────────┘                       └─────────┘
     │                                  │
     │ wasAssociatedWith                │ wasAssociatedWith
     ▼                                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Activity                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**YAML Specification**:
```yaml
pattern: delegation
relation: actedOnBehalfOf
domain: Agent
range: Agent
semantics: "Agent1 performed activity on behalf of Agent2"
cardinality: "Agent may act on behalf of 0..1 Agent"
requires: "Both agents wasAssociatedWith same Activity"
source: "PROV-O"
```

From Event Knowledge Graphs: Actors modeled as entities with their own behavioral patterns.

```
┌─────────────┐                      ┌─────────────┐
│   Actor     │                      │   Entity    │
│ (Worker)    │                      │  (Object)   │

Entity n2 df-path:  ───e5───►e2───►e6───►e7───►...
```

**YAML Specification**:
```yaml

  entity: "The object being worked on"
  events: "Sequence of synchronized events"
variants:
  singleton_task:
    description: "Actor performs single activity then moves on"
    synchronization: "One event only"
  multi_activity_task:

       │ bears                          │ mediated by
       ▼                                ▼

  relator_foundation: "Relators founded by unique events"
source: "UFO (Guizzardi et al. 2021)"
```

### 5.2 Focus Participation Pattern

Agent is the focus of an intentional event.

```yaml
pattern: focus_participation
definition: "Endurant (agent) is the primary subject/focus of an event"
relation: is_focus_of
domain: Agent
range: Event
semantics: "Events are carved out of scenes by having underlying endurants as their focus"
use_cases:
  - "Agent's walk event focuses on the agent's walking intention"
  - "Change in agent's intention causes different event manifestation"

### 9.2 Multi-Agent Coordination Schema

```typescript
interface AgentCoordination {
  coordinator: Agent;
  subordinates: Agent[];
  coordinationType: CoordinationType;
  workflow: WorkflowPattern;
}

enum CoordinationType {
  HIERARCHICAL = "hierarchical",
  PEER_TO_PEER = "peer_to_peer",
  BROADCAST = "broadcast",
  CONSENSUS = "consensus"
}

enum WorkflowPattern {
  PROMPT_CHAINING = "prompt_chaining",
  PARALLEL_SECTIONING = "parallel_sectioning",
  ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER = "orchestrator_worker",
  EVALUATOR_OPTIMIZER = "evaluator_optimizer"
}
```

## 10. Pattern Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Pattern |
|----------|---------------------|
| Single agent executing task | `performs` participation |
| Agent starting workflow | `initiates` participation |
| Agent delegating to specialists | Coordinator-Specialist pattern |
| Multi-level agent hierarchy | Hierarchical Delegation pattern |
| Tracking provenance | PROV Association/Attribution |
| Process mining with actors | Actor as Entity pattern |
| Agent coordination points | Entity Synchronization pattern |
| Complex task decomposition | Task-Management Activity pattern |
| Iterative refinement | Evaluator-Optimizer pattern |
| Parallel execution | Parallel Sectioning pattern |
