Table 47: Merging 4 example NDAs: **Step 3 (Scoring Example – Prompt)**


Please score the merged NDA _<_ S _>_ in terms of how much redundant information is contained, independent of the original
NDAs, as well as how much information is retained from the original NDAs.


A score of 10 for redundancy implies that absolutely no information is redundant, while a score of 0 implies that at least half
of the information is redundant (so everything is at least mentioned twice).


A score of 10 for retained information implies that all information from the original NDAs is retained, while a score of 0
implies that no information is retained.


You may provide reasoning for your scoring, but the final score for redundancy should be between the tags _<_ Redundancy _>_
and _<_ /Redundancy _>_, and the final score for retained information should be between the tags _<_ Retained _>_ and _<_ /Retained _>_,
without any additional text within any of those tags.

Table 48: Merging 4 example NDAs: **Step 3 (Scoring Example – Responses)**


**Response (1/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 5 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


_<_ Retained _>_ 8 _<_ /Retained _>_


Reasoning:


The merged NDA _<_ S _>_ retains most of the information from the original NDAs, combining relevant clauses and terms
into a single comprehensive agreement. However, some redundancy is present as similar information is mentioned multiple
times, such as the definition of ”Confidential Information” and the obligations of the receiving party. Additionally, some
specific details from the original NDAs are not included in the merged NDA, such as the exclusion criteria in Doc2 and the
provisions for non-competition in Doc3 and Doc4. Nonetheless, the merged NDA captures the essence of the original NDAs
and includes all key information necessary for a non-disclosure agreement.


**Response (2/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 8 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


_<_ Retained _>_ 10 _<_ /Retained _>_


Reasoning:


The merged NDA _<_ S _>_ retains all the key information from the original NDAs, including the purpose of the agreement,
the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the receiving party, breach penalties, applicability to parties and
successors, governing law, and signature requirements.


There is some redundant information, such as the inclusion of system designs, architectural schematics, proprietary computational algorithms, internal software blueprints, and intellectual property awaiting patents from both Doc3 and Doc4.
However, this redundancy is minor and does not significantly impact the overall usefulness of the NDA.


Overall, the merged NDA _<_ S _>_ retains all important information while minimizing redundancy, making it highly effective
in conveying the necessary terms and obligations of the agreement. Therefore, it receives a score of 8 for redundancy and a
score of 10 for retained information.


**Response (3/3):**


_<_ Redundancy _>_ 7 _<_ /Redundancy _>_


_<_ Retained _>_ 10 _<_ /Retained _>_


Reasoning:


The merged NDA _<_ S _>_ contains some redundant information, such as the definition of ”Confidential Information” and the
obligations of the receiving party. However, it retains all the important information from the original NDAs, including the
purpose of the agreement, the specific types of confidential information, the breach penalties, the applicability to parties and
successors, the governing law, and the provisions regarding non-competition, amendment, and termination. Additionally, it
incorporates the additional information about the agreement’s validity period and the option for legal recourse in case of
non-compliance. Therefore, the merged NDA _<_ S _>_ scores a 7 for redundancy and a 10 for retained information.
