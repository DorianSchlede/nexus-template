## Patterns

**Total Patterns**: 205

### 1. Descriptive vs Revisionary Ontology Approach

UFO adopts a descriptive methodology that prioritizes cognitive and linguistic aspects of human understanding over revisionary philosophical positions. This is a top-down theoretical approach grounded in philosophy of language and cognitive science, rather than purely formal logic or empirical data.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:255-257)**
  > UFO was constructed as a descriptive (as opposed to a revisionary) project (Strawson, 1959). This means that it is an ontology that takes into full consideration both cognitive and linguistic aspects

---

### 2. Multi-Disciplinary Theoretical Foundation

The methodology synthesizes multiple theoretical disciplines (formal ontology, cognitive science, linguistics, philosophical logic) into a unified framework. This represents a top-down approach that draws on established theoretical work rather than building from empirical observations.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:98-100)**
  > UFO was developed by consistently putting together theories from areas such as formal ontology in philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical logics

---

### 3. Four-Category Ontology Framework

Merged from 2 sources. Top-down theoretical framework requiring four fundamental categories: individuals, universals, substantial entities, and accidents/tropes. This philosophical commitment drove UFO design as a principled alternative to simpler ontological frameworks.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:116-117)**
  > UFO is a four-category ontology that addresses fundamental conceptual modeling notions via a set of micro-theories

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:126-129)**
  > we needed an ontological theory that would countenance both individuals and universals and one that would include not only substantial individuals and universals but also accidents (particularized properties, moments, qualities, modes, tropes)

---

### 4. Micro-Theory Modular Architecture

The methodology organizes the ontology into discrete micro-theories addressing specific domains: types/taxonomies, part-whole relations, intrinsic properties, relational properties, roles, events, and multi-level modeling. This modular approach enables focused development and extension.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:117-142)**
  > UFO (Guizzardi, 2005; Guizzardi et al., 2015b) was developed by consistently putting together theories... via a set of micro-theories, including: a theory of types and taxonomic structures... a theory of part-whole relations... a theory of events

---

### 5. Foundational Ontology Unification

The methodology explicitly aims to unify existing foundational ontologies (DOLCE and GFO) rather than building from scratch. This demonstrates a synthetic top-down approach that integrates prior theoretical work into a coherent framework.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:171-176)**
  > their first attempt was to unify DOLCE and GFO to produce a reference foundational ontology for conceptual modeling, hence the name Unified Foundational Ontology

---

### 6. Intra-Worldview Consistency Engineering

The methodology emphasizes engineering mechanisms for ontological consistency within a worldview and interoperability between worldviews. This is a practical, tool-oriented approach to ontology design that prioritizes usability for conceptual modeling.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:266-269)**
  > The ultimate goal of this project is, thus, providing well-founded engineering mechanisms for helping modelers to achieve intra-worldview consistency... and inter-worldview interoperability

---

### 7. Three-Fragment Ontology Structure

The methodology partitions the ontology into three complementary fragments addressing different aspects of reality: endurants (UFO-A), perdurants/events (UFO-B), and social/intentional entities (UFO-C). This layered architecture allows incremental development and application.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:270-280)**
  > UFO is organized in three main fragments: UFO-A, which is an ontology of endurants; UFO-B, which is an ontology of perdurants... UFO-C, which is an ontology of social and intentional entities

---

### 8. First-Order Modal Logic Formalization

The methodology employs formal first-order modal logic (QS5 with Barcan formula) for rigorous axiomatization. This enables automated theorem proving for consistency and satisfiability checks, demonstrating a formal, top-down theoretical approach.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:428-442)**
  > we present a first-order modal theory of endurant types, in which types and their instances are both in the domain of quantification... the first-order modal logic QS5 plus the Barcan formula and its converse suffices

---

### 9. Automated Prover Validation

The methodology validates the ontology through automated theorem provers, using TPTP syntax for machine-readable axiomatization. This adds empirical rigor to the theoretical foundation through computational verification.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:440-442)**
  > this section is based on a first-order logic formalization of UFO specified in the TPTP syntax (Sutcliffe, 2017), and submitted to multiple automated provers for consistency and satisfability checks

---

### 10. OntoUML Language Co-Evolution

The methodology includes co-development of a modeling language (OntoUML) that reflects the ontological micro-theories. This creates a feedback loop where practical application informs theoretical refinement, adding a bottom-up empirical component to the primarily top-down approach.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:209-214)**
  > Of all UFO's applications, one deserves special attention, namely, the use of UFO in the design of an ontology-driven conceptual modeling language, which later came to be known as OntoUML

---

### 11. Case Study Illustration Approach

The methodology validates theoretical constructs through detailed case study analysis covering diverse domains. This hybrid approach combines top-down theoretical axiomatization with bottom-up case-based demonstration and validation.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 2:539-544)**
  > This section presents an analysis and formalization of various cases that originate from the First FOUST Workshop... They cover a number of topics (composition/constitution, roles, property change, event change, and conceptual evolution)

---

### 12. Pluralistic Realism Stance

The methodology adopts a pluralistic realist philosophical stance: reality exists independently but can be conceptualized in multiple valid ways. This grounds the ontological framework in philosophical realism while acknowledging cognitive mediation, supporting the descriptive rather than revisionary approach.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 1:258-269)**
  > Tables, detente, machinists, and love affairs are absolutely not merely epistemic entities... They are the world taken a certain way... We should still carve reality at its joints

---

### 13. Automated Benchmarking Framework for LLM Evaluation

Bottom-up empirical methodology using automated trace replay to benchmark LLM-generated smart contracts. The framework generates conforming and non-conforming traces from process models, then replays them against generated smart contracts to measure precision, recall, and F1 scores. This is a data-driven, empirical approach to evaluating code generation quality.

**Sources**:

- **21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:230-241)**
  > An established method to benchmark the correctness of a blockchain-based business process is to replay all possible conforming traces (which the smart contract has to accept) and replay a set of non-conforming traces

---

### 14. Iterative Prompt Refinement Through Pre-runs

Hybrid methodology combining manual investigation with automated testing. Prompts evolved from loosely defined zero-shot instructions to more specific one-shot and two-shot prompts through iterative refinement based on pre-run results. This represents an empirical, bottom-up approach to prompt engineering.

**Sources**:

- **21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:458-464)**
  > To reduce the likelihood of our results being tainted by a poorly performing prompt, we tested, compared, and refined multiple versions in pre-runs, which we conducted with sets of five to twenty process models

---

### 15. Model-Driven Process to Smart Contract Transformation

Top-down methodology where formal process models (BPMN) serve as the specification from which executable smart contracts are derived. This represents a model-driven engineering approach that starts with high-level abstractions and transforms them to implementation.

**Sources**:

- **21-LLM_Smart_Contracts_from_BPMN (Chunk 1:54-56)**
  > Blockchain-based business process execution relies on a model-driven paradigm, where process descriptions are transformed into executable artefacts based on rule-based transformation tools

---

### 16. Literature Review with Concept Matrix

Top-down methodology using systematic literature review to identify process characteristics for RPA viability assessment. Follows established guidelines (Webster & Watson) to derive criteria from academic literature, then validates through concept matrix analysis.

**Sources**:

- **22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:118-123)**
  > To obtain a comprehensive list of potential process characteristic evaluation criteria, a literature review following the guidelines proposed by [34] is conducted... The identified criteria are then compiled, checked for redundancy and listed in a concept matrix

---

### 17. Multi-Perspective Evaluation Framework Design

Top-down framework design organizing 13 criteria into 5 evaluation perspectives. The Process Characteristics Evaluation Framework (PCEF) provides structured approach for assessing RPA suitability based on theoretically-derived perspectives rather than empirical observation alone.

**Sources**:

- **22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:234-236)**
  > We present five perspectives - task, time, data, system, and human - that contain several characteristics that analysts can use to evaluate a process accordingly

---

### 18. Process Mining Validation with Event Logs

Bottom-up empirical validation using real-world event log data (BPI Challenge 2019 dataset with 1.5M+ events). Process mining tools analyze actual process execution to validate the theoretical framework, representing hybrid methodology combining top-down theory with bottom-up data.

**Sources**:

- **22-RPA_Framework_BPM_Activities (Chunk 1:421-426)**
  > The evaluation focuses on event logs generated through PAIS. Event logs reveal insights about the business process and its execution. We aim at an objective evaluation by using a publicly available data-set to show the applicability of the PCEF

---

### 19. Ontology Engineering Through Philosophical Grounding

Top-down methodology grounded in philosophical foundations. UFO development explicitly rejects pure empiricism in favor of descriptive metaphysics, drawing from formal ontology, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical logics to establish principled conceptual modeling foundations.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:83-90)**
  > Our program was motivated by the strong belief that any serious scientific discipline should have well-established and explicitly defined metaphysical foundations (Bunge, 1977) or that, as nicely put by Collier (1994): 'the opposite of ontology is not non-ontology, but bad ontology'

---

### 20. Descriptive Metaphysics Over Revisionary Ontology

Top-down methodology prioritizing cognitive and linguistic alignment. UFO explicitly positions itself as descriptive metaphysics that accounts for how humans actually conceptualize reality, rather than prescribing an idealized formal system that ignores modeler intuitions.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:116-119)**
  > any attempt to develop ontological foundations for conceptual modeling should take both human cognition and human linguistic competence seriously; it should be a project in descriptive metaphysics and not in revisionary ontology

---

### 21. Stratified Ontology Architecture

Top-down layered methodology with UFO-A (endurants/structural), UFO-B (perdurants/events), and UFO-C (intentional/social) built as interconnected strata. Each stratum addresses specific conceptual modeling requirements with dedicated micro-theories.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:170-193)**
  > The ontology is divided in three strata dealing with different aspects of reality, namely: UFO-A: An Ontology of Endurants... UFO-B: An Ontology of Perdurants... UFO-C: An Ontology of Intentional and Social Entities

---

### 22. Ontology-Based Language Engineering

Top-down methodology using foundational ontology to systematically derive a modeling language (OntoUML). The language metamodel incorporates formal syntactical constraints that delimit valid models to those representing intended states admitted by the underlying ontology.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:213-222)**
  > The idea was to employ the ontology-based language engineering method... to design a language for structural conceptual modeling that would have two main characteristics. Firstly, the worldview embedded in the language... should be isomorphic to the ontological distinctions put forth by UFO-A

---

### 23. Empirical Validation Through Systematic Language Subversions

Hybrid methodology using observed 'systematic subversions' of OntoUML as empirical feedback to refine theoretical foundations. User deviations from formal syntax revealed gaps in UFO theory, driving evolution of both language and underlying ontology.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:343-352)**
  > we have managed to observe a number of different ways in which people would slightly subvert the syntax of the language, ultimately creating what we could call 'systematic subversions' of the language. These 'subversions' would (purposefully) produce models that were grammatically incorrect

---

### 24. Anti-Pattern Detection and Rectification

Bottom-up empirical methodology using a repository of OntoUML models across domains to identify recurring problematic patterns (anti-patterns). Empirical studies validated detection methods and developed rectification solutions based on observed modeling practices.

**Sources**:

- **23-UFO_Story_Ontological_Foundations (Chunk 1:318-338)**
  > By using this model repository as a benchmark, in three different empirical studies... managed to show that this approach for model validation via visual simulation is not only able to detect deviations between formally valid model instances and intended model instances, but is also able to detect recurrent structures that tend to cause these deviations

---

### 25. METHONTOLOGY for Ontology Development

Top-down systematic methodology with five stages: Specification, Conceptualization, Formalization, Implementation, and Maintenance. Follows established ontology engineering methodology to develop BBO through principled phases from requirements to formal implementation.

**Sources**:

- **31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:95-104)**
  > a presentation of METHONTOLOGY (Fernandez et al., 1997), the methodology followed to develop BBO in five classical stages. Specification states why the ontology is being built... Conceptualization consists in structuring the domain knowledge... Formalization transforms the conceptual model into a formal model

---

### 26. Competency Questions for Ontology Specification

Top-down requirements methodology using competency questions to define ontology scope. Questions collected from domain experts and literature specify what the ontology must be able to answer, driving conceptualization and enabling validation.

**Sources**:

- **31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:164-166)**
  > Competency questions are recognized to be a good means to materialize ontology specifications (Gruninger and Fox, 1995). After meeting experts and analyzing related works... we collected a set of 22 competency questions

---

### 27. Meta-Model Fragment Reuse and Extension

Hybrid methodology combining top-down standard reuse with targeted extensions. Rather than building from scratch, BBO selectively extracts relevant BPMN 2.0 fragments dealing with process description, then extends with additional taxonomies for resources, agents, and manufacturing facilities.

**Sources**:

- **31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:89-92)**
  > The core of BBO is an ontological representation of a fragment extracted from the BPMN 2.0 meta-model. Hence, we exploited the process-execution specifications of BPMN 2.0. In addition, we have extended the core of BBO with taxonomies, concepts, relations and attributes

---

### 28. UML to OWL Conversion Rules

Hybrid formalization methodology combining automated transformation (UML to OWL conversion rules) with manual formalization of natural language specifications. Systematic algorithm converts class hierarchies, relationships, attributes, and cardinalities while human expertise handles semantic nuances.

**Sources**:

- **31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:359-386)**
  > First, we designed and applied a set of conversion rules that automatically generated an OWL representation from the UML diagrams of BBO. Second, we manually turned various natural language specifications in the BPMN document into a formal OWL representation

---

### 29. Schema Metrics for Ontology Evaluation

Bottom-up quantitative evaluation methodology using schema metrics to assess ontology quality. Relationship Diversity (60%) indicates BBO is not just a taxonomy but rich with relationships. Schema Deepness (0.78) shows detailed domain coverage. Metrics provide objective quality indicators.

**Sources**:

- **31-BBO_BPMN_Ontology (Chunk 1:456-466)**
  > We used the two schema metrics introduced in (Tartir and Arpinar, 2007) to evaluate BBO: the relationship diversity (RD) and the schema deepness (SD)... RD = NR / (NR+ NH), which exceeds for us 50%... SD = NH/NC

---

### 30. OntoUML Model-Based Representation

Top-down methodology using OntoUML as a visual modeling language grounded in UFO foundational ontology. Models are created through conceptual analysis of domain situations, then represented formally with stereotypes like subkind, role, mode, etc. The methodology emphasizes creating well-founded conceptual models before implementation.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:5-11)**
  > In Figure 8, we present an OntoUML model [17] representing this situation. In this model, a Rose is modeled as a subkind of Flower.

---

### 31. Partial Formalization from Conceptual Models

Methodology involves translating OntoUML conceptual models into partial logical formalizations using first-order logic predicates and subsumption relations. This bridges the gap between intuitive visual models and rigorous formal semantics.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:14-23)**
  > In the sequel, we show a partial formalization of this case. ObjectKind(Flower) SubKind(Rose) Rose ⊑ Flower

---

### 32. Classical Modal Approach to Events

Top-down philosophical methodology grounded in classical metaphysics. Events are treated as modally fragile perdurants that cannot qualitatively change while maintaining numerical identity. This philosophical commitment shapes how change is modeled as either event variation or underlying endurant change.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:103-117)**
  > In UFO, we follow a classical view of events in which events are modally fragile entities. So, events cannot bear modal properties, they cannot genuinely change

---

### 33. Endurant Focus Pattern for Event Modeling

Methodological pattern where events are carved out of scenes by identifying underlying endurants (dispositions, modes) as their focus. The endurant serves as the stable element that changes, while events are immutable manifestations of those endurant changes.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:105-110)**
  > Events are also polygenic manifestations of (possibly bundles of) dispositions... These (bundles of) dispositions are said to be the focuses of these events

---

### 34. Higher-Order Type Pattern for Concept Evolution

Methodology for handling concept evolution using higher-order types (types whose instances are themselves types). Identifies invariant structures (base types) and variable constraints (instantiating types) to model anticipated evolution while maintaining semantic stability.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:403-429)**
  > According to the 'marriage' concept evolution case, 'a marriage is a contract that is regulated by civil and social constraints', and 'these constraints can change but the meaning continues'

---

### 35. Anticipated vs Unanticipated Evolution

Methodological distinction between anticipated evolution (designed into the model using powertype patterns and higher-order types) and unanticipated evolution (requiring model refactoring operations). Encourages proactive design for foreseeable change.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:536-544)**
  > We should observe that we are dealing here with a case of anticipated evolution, i.e., when it is possible at specification time to foresee that types are likely to change

---

### 36. Empirical Validation through Domain Application

Bottom-up validation methodology where the foundational ontology is validated through extensive application across diverse domains including agriculture, accounting, business processes, legal issues, software engineering, etc. The breadth of successful applications provides empirical grounding for theoretical constructs.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:567-663)**
  > Over the years, UFO has been used for the development of core and domain ontologies on a wide range of domains, both in academic and industrial contexts

---

### 37. OntoUML as a Service Infrastructure

Practical methodology support through tooling: microservice architecture decoupling model services (transformations, verifications, simulations) from modeling tools. Uses HTTP and JSON for interoperability, enabling integration with various CASE tools like Visual Paradigm.

**Sources**:

- **01-UFO (Chunk 3:697-709)**
  > Currently, the development of UFO-based models through OntoUML is supported by a microservice-based infrastructure. The OntoUML as a Service infrastructure (OaaS)

---

### 38. Graph-Based Data Modeling for Knowledge Graphs

Bottom-up, empirical methodology starting from data representation needs. Knowledge graphs emerge from practical scenarios requiring integration, management, and extraction of value from diverse data sources at large scale. The methodology prioritizes flexibility and evolvability over upfront schema definition.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 1:67-77)**
  > Underlying all such developments is the core idea of using graphs to represent data, often enhanced with some way to explicitly represent knowledge

---

### 39. Incremental Schema Refinement

Hybrid methodology where schema emerges through iterative refinement as data diversity increases. Starting with relational assumptions, the methodology discovers that flexible binary relations (graph edges) naturally accommodate incomplete and diverse data without requiring upfront schema commitment.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 1:339-399)**
  > Along the way, the board has to incrementally change the schema several times in order to support new sources of data. Each such change requires a costly remodelling

---

### 40. Inclusive Definition Approach

Methodological stance favoring inclusive, broad definitions over restrictive technical ones. Knowledge graphs are defined by intent (accumulating real-world knowledge) rather than specific technical requirements, allowing diverse implementations under a unifying conceptual umbrella.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 1:132-163)**
  > Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world

---

### 41. Three Schema Types Methodology

Methodological framework distinguishing three complementary approaches to graph schema: semantic (defining term meanings for reasoning), validating (enforcing structural constraints), and emergent (automatically extracting structure from data). Each serves different purposes and can be combined.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 2:89-98)**
  > schemata can be used to prescribe a high-level structure and/or semantics that the graph follows or should follow. We discuss three types of graph schemata: semantic, validating, and emergent

---

### 42. Open World Assumption Methodology

Methodological commitment to Open World Assumption (OWA) for semantic schemas, acknowledging that knowledge graphs represent incomplete knowledge. Local Closed World Assumption (LCWA) provides a pragmatic middle ground where specific portions can be assumed complete.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 2:192-222)**
  > Semantic schema are typically defined for incomplete graph data, where the absence of an edge between two nodes... does not mean that the relation does not hold in the real world

---

### 43. Shapes-Based Validation Methodology

Bottom-up validation methodology using shapes (ShEx, SHACL) that target nodes and specify constraints. Unlike semantic schemas that infer new data, validating schemas check existing data against explicit structural requirements, complementing inference with validation.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 2:250-261)**
  > A standard way to define a validating schema for graphs is using shapes. A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints on those nodes

---

### 44. Quotient Graph Framework for Emergent Schema

Automatic, bottom-up methodology for schema discovery. Quotient graphs partition nodes by equivalence relations (e.g., type, shape) and merge them while preserving structural properties. The approach extracts latent structure from data rather than imposing it top-down.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 2:434-458)**
  > A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some equivalence relation

---

### 45. Model-Theoretic Semantics Methodology

Top-down deductive methodology grounding knowledge representation in model-theoretic semantics. Interpretations map data graph terms to domain entities, and axioms define semantic conditions that constrain valid models. This provides rigorous foundations for automated reasoning.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 3:211-227)**
  > In this section, we describe ways in which more complex entailments can be expressed and automated... we focus on ontologies, which constitute a formal representation of knowledge

---

### 46. Rule-Based Reasoning Methodology

Practical reasoning methodology using if-then rules with graph patterns as body and head. Rules can be applied through materialisation (recursive forward chaining until fixpoint) or query rewriting (extending queries to find entailed results). Corresponds to Datalog and Horn clauses.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 4:21-35)**
  > One of the most straightforward ways to provide automated access to deductive knowledge is through inference rules encoding if-then-style consequences. A rule is composed of a body (if) and a head (then)

---

### 47. Inductive Learning Taxonomy

Complementary bottom-up methodology for knowledge acquisition through induction. Taxonomy includes graph analytics (unsupervised), knowledge graph embeddings (self-supervised), graph neural networks (supervised), and symbolic learning (rule/axiom mining). Each approach offers different tradeoffs between interpretability and learning power.

**Sources**:

- **02-KG (Chunk 4:215-358)**
  > inductively acquiring knowledge involves generalising patterns from a given set of input observations, which can then be used to generate novel but potentially imprecise predictions

---

### 48. Translational Embedding Learning Approach

TransE and related translational models use a geometric approach where relation embeddings act as translation vectors in embedding space. The methodology learns vectors es, rp, and eo aiming to make es + rp approximate eo for positive edges, while keeping es + rp away from eo for negative examples. This bottom-up, data-driven approach learns representations directly from observed graph structure.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:7-24)**
  > Translational models interpret edge labels as transformations from subject nodes to object nodes; for example, in the edge [San Pedro] bus Moon Valley, the edge label bus is seen as transforming [San Pedro] to [Moon Valley]

---

### 49. Tensor Decomposition for Graph Embeddings

A mathematical methodology for deriving graph embeddings through tensor rank decomposition. The approach encodes graphs as one-hot 3-order tensors and applies Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition to extract latent factors. This represents a bottom-up empirical methodology that learns structure from data using mathematical decomposition techniques.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:63-79)**
  > Tensor decomposition involves decomposing a tensor into more elemental tensors from which the original tensor can be recomposed... These elemental tensors can be viewed as capturing latent factors underlying the information contained in the original tensor

---

### 50. Neural Network Plausibility Scoring

Neural models like SME, NTN, and MLP use neural networks with learnable parameters to compute plausibility scores for edges. This methodology moves beyond linear/bilinear assumptions to capture more complex patterns in data through non-linear functions, representing an empirical bottom-up approach.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:240-258)**
  > A limitation of the previously discussed approaches is that they assume either linear or bilinear operations over embeddings to compute plausibility scores. A number of approaches rather use neural networks to learn embeddings with non-linear scoring functions for plausibility

---

### 51. Convolutional Kernel-Based Feature Extraction

Convolutional approaches apply 2D convolutional kernels over entity and relation embeddings to extract features. This methodology adapts image processing techniques for graph learning, using parameter sharing through small kernels applied across different matrix regions.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:260-291)**
  > ConvE proposes to generate a matrix from es and rp by wrapping each vector over several rows and concatenating both matrices. The concatenated matrix serves as the input for a set of (2D) convolutional layers, which returns a feature map tensor

---

### 52. Language Model Transfer for Graph Embeddings

RDF2Vec and KGloVe adapt word embedding techniques (word2vec, GloVe) for graphs. RDF2Vec performs random walks on graphs and records paths as sentences for word2vec input. KGloVe uses personalized PageRank to determine node relatedness. This represents a hybrid methodology combining NLP techniques with graph structure.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:294-339)**
  > Embeddings generated by both approaches are widely used in natural language processing tasks. Another approach for graph embeddings is thus to leverage proven approaches for language embeddings

---

### 53. Entailment-Aware Embedding with Fuzzy Logics

Hybrid methodology combining deductive knowledge (rules/ontologies) with inductive embeddings. KALE uses t-norm fuzzy logics to compute plausibility updates when applying rules to predicted edges. This represents a methodological bridge between symbolic rule-based approaches and numeric embedding approaches.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-390)**
  > KALE computes entity and relation embeddings using a translational model that is adapted to further consider rules using t-norm fuzzy logics

---

### 54. Recursive Graph Neural Network Architecture

RecGNNs use recursive message passing where nodes update their state vectors based on neighbors' states through a parametric transition function. The methodology applies functions recursively up to a fixpoint, using supervised nodes to learn parameters. This represents a bottom-up learning approach that builds on graph topology.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:452-494)**
  > Recursive graph neural networks are the seminal approach to graph neural networks. The approach is conceptually similar to the systolic abstraction... where messages are passed between neighbours towards recursively computing some result

---

### 55. GNN Transition and Output Function Learning

The GNN methodology uses parametric transition functions fw(.) to update node states based on neighbor information, and output functions gw'(.) to compute final outputs. Both functions are implemented as neural networks with learnable parameters trained on supervised examples.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:464-489)**
  > Scarselli et al. proposed what they generically call a graph neural network, which takes as input a directed graph where nodes and edges are associated with feature vectors... Each node is associated with a state vector, which is recursively updated based on information from the nodes neighbours

---

### 56. Convolutional Graph Neural Network Approach

ConvGNNs adapt image processing convolution concepts to graphs by applying operators over local graph regions (node neighborhoods). Approaches use spectral or spatial representations to induce regular structure, or attention mechanisms to learn which neighbor features are most important.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:593-643)**
  > The core idea in the image setting is to apply small kernels over localised regions of an image using a convolution operator to extract features from that local region. When applied to all local regions, the convolution outputs a feature map

---

### 57. Symbolic Learning via Rule Mining

Rule mining methodology learns interpretable logical rules from data rather than numeric embeddings. Rules serve as models that can be used for deductive reasoning and offer explainability. This represents a hybrid approach that bridges inductive learning with symbolic/deductive representations.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:646-702)**
  > An alternative approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn hypotheses in a symbolic (logical) language that explain a given set of positive and negative edges. These edges are typically generated from the knowledge graph in an automatic manner

---

### 58. Top-Down Rule Refinement in AMIE

AMIE uses a top-down methodology starting with rule heads and systematically applying refinements to build rule bodies. Three refinement types add edges with fresh variables, constants, or existing variables. This search-space exploration approach prunes based on support thresholds.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:772-827)**
  > AMIE adopts the PCA measure of confidence, and builds rules in a top-down fashion starting with rule heads... For each rule head of this form, three types of refinements are considered, each of which adds a new edge to the body of the rule

---

### 59. Differentiable Rule Mining via Matrix Operations

NeuralLP and DRUM use differentiable approaches where rule learning is formulated as matrix operations. Joins become matrix multiplications over adjacency matrices. This methodology enables end-to-end learning of rules using attention mechanisms and recurrent neural networks.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:867-909)**
  > The core idea is that the joins in rule bodies can be represented as matrix multiplication... Adjacency matrices representing relations can be multiplied to compute entailed edges

---

### 60. Axiom Mining for Disjointness Discovery

Axiom mining methodology extracts ontological axioms like disjointness constraints from data. Approaches use negative association rule mining, TF-IDF cosine similarity, or terminological cluster trees to identify disjoint class descriptions. This represents bottom-up extraction of schema-level knowledge.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:13-57)**
  > Aside from rules, more general forms of axioms expressed in logical languages such as DLs can be mined from a knowledge graph. We can divide these approaches into those mining specific axioms and more general axioms

---

### 61. DL-Learner Class Learning Methodology

Concept learning methodology that discovers DL class descriptions to separate positive and negative examples. Uses refinement operators to move between general and specific classes, with confidence scoring functions and search strategies analogous to rule mining systems like AMIE.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:59-76)**
  > DL-Learner is based on algorithms for class learning whereby given a set of positive nodes and negative nodes, the goal is to find a logical class description that divides the positive and negative sets

---

### 62. Agile Knowledge Graph Creation Methodology

Agile or pay-as-you-go methodology for knowledge graph creation. The approach starts with an initial core and incrementally enriches from additional sources. This represents a pragmatic, iterative methodology that adapts to available data sources and application requirements.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:110-133)**
  > The appropriate methodology to follow when creating a knowledge graph depends on the actors involved, the domain, the envisaged applications... generally speaking the flexibility of knowledge graphs lends itself to starting with an initial core that can be incrementally enriched

---

### 63. Text Extraction Pipeline Methodology

Bottom-up text extraction methodology involving pre-processing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking (EL), and Relation Extraction (RE). This pipeline approach transforms unstructured text into structured graph data through sequential processing stages.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:166-181)**
  > Techniques from Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction can be applied. Though processes vary considerably across text extraction frameworks... four core tasks for text extraction

---

### 64. Distant Supervision for Entity and Relation Extraction

Distant supervision methodology leverages existing knowledge graph content to bootstrap extraction from text. Known entities and relations serve as seed examples to learn patterns for detecting similar entities and relations. This hybrid approach combines existing structured knowledge with text mining.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:220-290)**
  > Distant supervision uses known entities in a knowledge graph as seed examples through which similar entities can be detected... finds sentences in a large corpus mentioning pairs of entities with a known relation, which are used to learn patterns

---

### 65. Wrapper-Based Markup Extraction

Wrapper induction methodology extracts knowledge from HTML/markup documents. Modern approaches use distant supervision to automatically induce wrappers by finding paths in markup that connect known entity pairs. High-confidence paths are then used to extract novel edges.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:457-510)**
  > Many general approaches are based on wrappers that locate and extract useful information directly from the markup document... modern approaches apply distant supervision whereby EL is used to identify and link entities in the webpage to nodes in the knowledge graph

---

### 66. Direct Mapping from Structured Sources

Standardized methodology for transforming tabular data into graphs. Direct mapping creates edges where x represents the row, y the column name, and z the cell value. Primary/foreign key relationships enable entity linking across tables. This represents a deterministic, reversible transformation approach.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:586-629)**
  > A direct mapping automatically generates a graph from a table. A standard direct mapping creates an edge [x] y z for each non-header, non-empty, non-null cell of the table

---

### 67. Custom R2RML Mapping Methodology

Custom mapping methodology using declarative languages like R2RML to transform structured data to graphs. Supports templates combining multiple values, SQL queries for complex transformations, and alignment with existing knowledge graph vocabularies. Enables both ETL materialization and query rewriting virtualization.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:649-696)**
  > Declarative mapping languages allow for manually defining custom mappings from tabular sources to graphs. R2RML allows for mapping from individual rows to one or more custom edges, with nodes and edges defined as constants, cell values, or templates

---

### 68. Ontology Engineering Methodologies

Top-down methodologies for schema/ontology development. Evolution from waterfall approaches to agile methodologies like DILIGENT, eXtreme Design (XD), and Modular Ontology Modelling (MOM). Modern approaches incorporate ontology requirements via Competency Questions and Ontology Design Patterns.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:765-801)**
  > Ontology engineering refers to the development and application of methodologies for building ontologies... Early methodologies were often based on a waterfall-like process... more iterative and agile ways of building and maintaining ontologies have been proposed

---

### 69. Ontology Learning from Text

Semi-automated bottom-up methodology extracting ontological structure from text corpora. Uses measures of unithood and termhood for terminology extraction, Hearst patterns for subclass axioms, and textual definitions for taxonomy induction. Results inform manual ontology engineering processes.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 6:849-886)**
  > Ontology learning can be used to semi-automatically extract information from text that is useful for the ontology engineering process. Early methods focussed on extracting terminology... Axioms may also be extracted from text

---

### 70. Quality Assessment Dimension Framework

Systematic methodology for knowledge graph quality assessment. Organizes quality into dimensions (accuracy, coverage, coherency, succinctness) with corresponding quantitative metrics. This evaluation framework adapts database quality concepts for graph-structured knowledge.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:4-14)**
  > Quality dimensions capture aspects of multifaceted data quality which evolves from the traditional domain of databases to the domain of knowledge graphs... quality metrics provide ways to measure quantitative aspects of these dimensions

---

### 71. Semantic Accuracy Validation Methodology

Methodology for assessing whether graph content accurately represents real-world phenomena. Approaches include manual verification, multi-source cross-checking, and validation of extraction process quality using precision metrics with human experts or gold standards.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:50-65)**
  > Semantic accuracy is the degree to which data values correctly represent real world phenomena, which may be affected by imprecise extraction results, imprecise entailments, vandalism... options include manual verification or checking against several sources

---

### 72. Link Prediction for Knowledge Graph Completion

Bottom-up methodology for completing knowledge graphs using statistical/inductive techniques. Leverages knowledge graph embeddings and rule mining to predict missing links. Addresses general links, type links, and identity links with techniques adapted for each setting.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:295-334)**
  > Knowledge graph completion aims at filling in the missing edges of a knowledge graph... This task is often addressed with link prediction techniques proposed in Statistical Relational Learning, which predict the existence or probability of correctness of missing edges

---

### 73. Fact Validation with Reference Sources

Methodology for knowledge graph correction through fact checking against external sources. Approaches use verbalization functions to convert edges to natural language, then apply fact finder algorithms over bipartite graphs connecting sources and facts. Computes trustworthiness and plausibility scores iteratively.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:426-499)**
  > Fact validation involves assigning plausibility or veracity scores to facts/edges, typically between 0 and 1... works on fact validation are characterised by their consideration of external reference sources, which may be unstructured or structured

---

### 74. Inconsistency Repair via Minimal Hitting Sets

Automated methodology for repairing knowledge graph inconsistencies detected through ontological axioms like disjointness. Uses minimal hitting sets to identify edges to remove, selecting based on source trustworthiness scores. Revises knowledge graph to prevent re-entailment of removed edges.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:526-568)**
  > Techniques are required to repair inconsistencies, which is not trivial... Bonatti et al. propose an automated method to repair inconsistencies based on minimal hitting sets, where each set is a minimal explanation for an inconsistency

---

### 75. FAIR Principles for Data Publication

Methodological principles for publishing knowledge graphs. FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provides guidelines with specific sub-goals including persistent identifiers, rich metadata, standard protocols, shared formalisms, and clear licensing. Knowledge graph technologies directly support many FAIR requirements.

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 7:621-717)**
  > FAIR itself is an acronym for four foundational principles... Findability refers to ease of locating the dataset; Accessibility refers to ease of access; Interoperability refers to ease of exploitation with standard tools; Reusability refers to ease of re-use

---

### 76. Semi-Automated Ontology Mapping Methodology

The PROV-O to BFO mapping paper describes a hybrid methodology combining manual conceptual analysis with automated semantic web tools. This involves carefully evaluating necessary and sufficient conditions for class/relation instances, prioritizing semantic accuracy over fully-automated matching despite higher effort. The methodology balances theoretical criteria with practical engineering techniques.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:123-131)**
  > Our approach to mapping is based on the semi-automated curation of ontologies leveraging conceptual analysis techniques and semantic web technologies.

---

### 77. Theoretical Criteria-Driven Alignment

The mapping methodology separates theoretical criteria (what constitutes a successful alignment) from engineering techniques (how to verify and implement). This dual-track approach ensures both semantic correctness and practical implementability. The criteria include coherence, consistency, conservativity, and totality.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:128-131)**
  > Our methodology can be described first by the theoretical criteria we chose for a successful alignment, and second by the engineering techniques used for rigorously evaluating an alignment

---

### 78. Equivalence and Subsumption Mapping Relations

The methodology prioritizes two types of mapping predicates: equivalence (bidirectional, full semantic interoperability) and subsumption (one-way bridge). Equivalence provides strongest interoperability while subsumption allows non-injective mappings where multiple source terms map to a single target. Complex mappings use OWL unionOf, intersectionOf, property restrictions, and SWRL rules.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:146-164)**
  > Equivalence relations represented by OWL equivalentClass and OWL equivalentProperty give necessary and sufficient conditions... Subsumption relations represented by RDFS subClassOf or RDFS subPropertyOf give sufficient conditions

---

### 79. Coherence and Consistency Testing

The methodology requires testing alignments against model-theoretic semantics. Coherence ensures all classes can have instances (satisfiability). Consistency ensures no contradictions are derivable. These are verified using semantic reasoners like HermiT against canonical example instances (312 individuals tested in PROV-O case).

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:201-221)**
  > An ontology alignment is coherent if and only if all formulae in the aligned ontologies are satisfiable... A consistent alignment is free of entailed or derivable contradictions.

---

### 80. Conservativity Principle for Alignments

Based on the concept of conservative extensions in logic, this methodology criterion prevents alignments from introducing new subsumption or equivalence relationships within either source ontology. The approximate deductive difference between aligned and unaligned ontologies is computed to verify no hierarchy changes occur.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:241-267)**
  > The conservativity principle states that an ontology alignment should not change the semantic relationships between terms within each ontology.

---

### 81. Totality-Synonymy Spectrum

The methodology defines a spectrum of alignment completeness: total alignment (syntactic, every term mapped), interpretability (semantic, implications preserved), and synonymy (bidirectional full translation). Synonymy represents maximum interoperability where each ontology can be fully understood in terms of the other.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:273-347)**
  > An alignment is a total alignment of an ontology O1 to ontology O2... if and only if for any term in O1, there exists some term in O2... Two ontologies are synonymous if and only if there exist two sets of translation definitions

---

### 82. SPARQL-Based Verification Queries

The methodology uses SPARQL queries in continuous development pipelines to automatically verify alignment completeness. Queries check for unmapped terms, transitively entailed mappings, and property chain axioms. This enables automated progress tracking during the mapping project.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:398-421)**
  > A SPARQL query was developed for automatically verifying the Totality of the combined alignments... The query finds any PROV-O class or object property term such that it... is not transitively related

---

### 83. FAIR-Compliant Technical Artifacts

The methodology mandates FAIR compliance for all ontology mapping outputs. Artifacts are published in OWL 2 DL, serialized in RDF Turtle, maintained in versioned files separate from source ontologies, and archived on Zenodo with DOIs. This ensures reproducibility and reusability of mappings.

**Sources**:

- **04-PROV-O_to_BFO (Chunk 1:489-508)**
  > The technical artifacts produced by our work comply with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. All artifacts, data, and code are maintained in a public GitHub repository

---

### 84. Agentic Provenance Methodology

PROV-AGENT employs a methodology of extending existing standards (W3C PROV) with domain-specific concepts (MCP for AI agents). The approach integrates agent interactions as first-class provenance elements alongside traditional workflow tasks, enabling unified traceability graphs.

**Sources**:

- **03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:114-127)**
  > Our contributions are threefold: (1) PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends the W3C PROV standard and incorporates concepts from the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to represent agent actions

---

### 85. Decorator-Based Provenance Capture

The methodology uses Python decorators (@flowcept_agent_tool) for non-invasive instrumentation of MCP tools. This enables automatic provenance capture without modifying core logic. Each tool execution creates an AgentTool activity linked to the executing agent via PROV relationships.

**Sources**:

- **03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:343-351)**
  > In generic Python functions, applying the @flowcept_task decorator ensures that, upon execution, the function's inputs, outputs, and any generated telemetry or scheduling data are automatically captured.

---

### 86. Cross-Facility Evaluation Methodology

The PROV-AGENT methodology validates through real-world deployment across heterogeneous computing environments (edge devices, cloud services, HPC systems). Evaluation focuses on enabling specific provenance queries (lineage tracing, error propagation, decision influence) rather than just technical metrics.

**Sources**:

- **03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:36-37)**
  > a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments, demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability analysis

---

### 87. Philosophically-Grounded Ontology Development

DOLCE methodology grounds ontology categories in philosophical analysis, specifically adopting descriptive (rather than referentialist) metaphysics. Categories are influenced by natural language, human cognition, and social practices. This top-down approach from philosophy yields stable foundations used for 20+ years.

**Sources**:

- **05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:34-44)**
  > In order to rely on well-established modeling principles and theoretical bases, it is a common practice for the categories and relations of foundational ontologies to be philosophically grounded.

---

### 88. OntoClean Methodology

OntoClean is a methodology developed by Guarino and Welty for analyzing ontological categories through meta-properties like rigidity, identity, and unity. DOLCE uses OntoClean to distinguish essential from accidental properties, guiding decisions about entity classification and persistence conditions.

**Sources**:

- **05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:73-75)**
  > The analysis underlying the formalization of DOLCE leverages the techniques of ontological engineering and the study of classes' meta-properties of the OntoClean methodology

---

### 89. Modal Logic Formalization

DOLCE employs first-order modal logic (QS5) for maximum expressivity over computational tractability. This allows representing possible entities, counterfactuals, and necessary relationships. The possibilistic domain includes all possible entities regardless of actual existence, enabling robust philosophical grounding.

**Sources**:

- **05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:227-234)**
  > The formal theory of DOLCE is written in the first-order quantified modal logic QS5, including the Barcan and the converse Barcan formula... These assumptions entail a possibilistic view of the entities

---

### 90. Artifact-Based vs Role-Based Modeling

DOLCE methodology offers alternative modeling strategies based on whether properties are considered essential (artifact-based) or accidental (role-based). The choice depends on modeling purposes and persistence conditions. This flexibility allows DOLCE to accommodate different ontological commitments within a single framework.

**Sources**:

- **05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:453-472)**
  > DOLCE provides two ways to model this and similar examples. The first option, which we call artifact-based... The second option, called role-based, considers table and leg as roles of objects.

---

### 91. Constitution vs Composition Distinction

DOLCE methodology distinguishes constitution (cross-category dependence, e.g., statue and matter) from composition (same-category parthood, e.g., table and legs). Constitution relates entities with different persistence conditions while composition relates entities within the same category. This enables precise modeling of material change.

**Sources**:

- **05-DOLCE (Chunk 1:486-497)**
  > The constitution and composition relations in DOLCE capture distinct forms of dependence: the former is the dependence holding between entities with different essential properties (intercategorical)

---

### 92. BFO Realist Methodology

BFO methodology prioritizes minimalism and domain-neutrality. The ontology is kept small (34 terms) to enable modularity, division of expertise, and consistent representation across domains. Domain-specific terms belong in narrower ontology modules, not the top-level. This supports integration across 100+ ontology development groups.

**Sources**:

- **06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:47-52)**
  > BFO is an upper-level ontology developed to support integration of data obtained through scientific research. It is deliberately designed to be very small, so that it may represent in a consistent fashion those upper-level categories

---

### 93. Inherence-Based Dependence

BFO methodology uses inherence as the primitive relation for specific dependence. Qualities, functions, roles, and dispositions can only exist as properties of specific independent continuants. This constrains what kinds of entities can bear what kinds of dependent entities, providing clear ontological commitments.

**Sources**:

- **06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:186-191)**
  > Dependent continuants are related to their bearers by inherence. Inherence is defined as a one-sided, existential dependence relation.

---

### 94. Realizable Entity Pattern

BFO methodology introduces realizable entities (roles, dispositions, functions, capabilities) as dependent continuants that can be manifested in processes. This captures the distinction between having a capacity and exercising it. Functions, for example, may exist without ever being realized.

**Sources**:

- **06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:241-243)**
  > A realizable entity is defined as a specifically dependent continuant that has an independent continuant entity as its bearer, and whose instances can be realized (manifested, actualized, executed) in associated processes

---

### 95. Internally vs Externally Grounded Distinction

BFO methodology distinguishes roles (externally grounded, optional, context-dependent) from dispositions (internally grounded, reflecting physical makeup). This classification enables precise modeling of why an entity has certain capabilities - whether from its nature or its circumstances.

**Sources**:

- **06-BFO_Function_Role (Chunk 1:269-270, 333-334)**
  > A role is a realizable entity which exists because the bearer is in some special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances... A disposition is a realizable entity which is such that, if it ceases to exist, then its bearer is physically changed

---

### 96. Bicategorial Ontology Approach

BFO methodology reconciles 3D (continuant/thing) and 4D (occurrent/process) ontological perspectives rather than choosing one. This adapted from Zemach's 'Four Ontologies' enables natural treatment of both objects (things with spatial parts) and processes (entities with temporal parts) without forced reduction.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes (Chunk 1:296-342)**
  > BFO... is founded on a bicategorial approach which seeks to combine elements of both the three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives. Thus it incorporates an ontology of continuants and an ontology of occurrents within a single framework

---

### 97. Applied Ontology for Scientific Data

Applied ontology methodology grounds classifications in established scientific understanding rather than purely philosophical analysis. Ontologies extend the advantages of standardized units (like SI) to theoretical terminology. Terms represent types/universals that are instantiated in experiments.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes (Chunk 1:66-77)**
  > ontologies that are being developed on the basis of the assumption that, to create an ontology that brings benefits to scientists working with data in a given domain, the ontology should employ classifications that are based on the established scientific understanding

---

### 98. Process Classification via Instantiation

BFO methodology treats process measurements as instantiation relationships rather than quality attribution. Since processes cannot change (they ARE changes), speed/duration/rate are captured as determinate universals that processes instantiate. This avoids the need for qualities of occurrents while enabling rich process classification.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes (Chunk 1:770-801)**
  > an assertion to the effect that motion p has speed v... should be interpreted as being of the form: motion p instance_of universal motion with speed v

---

### 99. Hypothesis Mining Methodology

Knowledge graph methodology includes hypothesis induction and mining approaches. Given background knowledge, positive examples, and negative examples, the task is to find hypotheses (rules/axioms) that entail positive edges without entailing negative edges. Scoring uses support and confidence measures under various completeness assumptions (CWA, OWA, PCA).

**Sources**:

- **02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:537-548)**
  > The task of hypothesis induction assumes a particular graph entailment relation... Given background knowledge in the form of a knowledge graph, a set of positive edges, the task is to find a set of hypotheses

---

### 100. Process Profile Selective Abstraction

Top-down ontological methodology where process classification proceeds by selectively abstracting specific structural dimensions (speed, energy consumed, oxygen utilized) while ignoring others. This allows for principled classification of process universals by focusing on measurable aspects. The approach treats processes as having multiple determinable profile universals that can be isolated through measurement-focused abstraction.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:132-137)**
  > In each case we focus on some one structural dimension and thereby ignore, through a process of selective abstraction, all other dimensions within the whole process.

---

### 101. Process Classification Through Principled Division

Top-down methodology for creating process taxonomies through systematic division into types and subtypes. The approach emphasizes principled classification that ensures consistency and interoperability when annotations are needed for data in scientific domains like physiology or pathology. This is a foundational ontological approach to process typing.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:279-283)**
  > We have dealt in the foregoing with only a small selection of the ways in which processes can be classified through division into types and subtypes.

---

### 102. Process Nesting and Embedding Analysis

Methodology recognizing that processes exist within hierarchical nesting structures. Analysis can focus on different scales: motion relative to table, body-table system relative to earth, body-table-earth system relative to sun. This multi-scale embedding is fundamental to understanding process ontology and requires methodological consideration of scope and granularity.

**Sources**:

- **07-Classifying_Processes_Barry_Smith (Chunk 2:283-290)**
  > One important next step will deal with the ways in which such classification is complicated by the fact that processes are embedded within a series of larger process wholes, each nested within yet larger process wholes.

---

### 103. Standard-Driven Metamodel Design

Bottom-up methodology where the metamodel is designed from practical implementation requirements. OCEL 2.0 was designed to facilitate exchange of event logs from diverse information systems, balancing interoperability, scalability, data integrity, simplified analysis, and future-proofing. The standard emerged from empirical needs of the process mining community.

**Sources**:

- **09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:88-91)**
  > The purpose of the standard is to guide the implementation of conformant process mining tools, and to provide the basis for the development of training material and other resources for users.

---

### 104. Iterative Standard Evolution Through Community Feedback

Empirical, bottom-up methodology for standard development. OCEL 2.0 evolved from OCEL 1.0 based on community survey (289 participants including practitioners, researchers, vendors, end-users), IEEE Task Force discussions, and experience applying OCPM techniques. The standard aims to strike a middle ground between simplicity and expressiveness based on real-world feedback.

**Sources**:

- **09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:261-278)**
  > In 2021, a survey was conducted by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining. The goal was to collect requirements for a new standard succeeding XES. The online survey with 289 participants...showed the need for supporting object-centricity.

---

### 105. Formal Definition Grounding Practical Implementation

Hybrid methodology combining theoretical formalization with practical implementation. Formal mathematical definitions (set theory, functions) ground the conceptual metamodel, which then maps to concrete storage formats (SQLite, XML, JSON). Authors encourage adoption of formal definitions in scientific papers to improve reliability.

**Sources**:

- **09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:335-342)**
  > The theoretical foundation is crucial for understanding and using OCEL 2.0. These definitions form the basis for concrete exchange formats discussed later. The connection between theory and practice ensures that both the relational model and XML schema respect the standard's principles.

---

### 106. Object-Centric Process Mining Paradigm Shift

Bottom-up methodology grounded in empirical reality of IT systems. Rather than forcing data into single-case abstractions, OCPM starts from actual multi-entity event data as recorded in enterprise systems. This empirical grounding addresses convergence/divergence problems that arise when flattening many-to-many relationships to single case notions.

**Sources**:

- **09-OCEL_20_Specification (Chunk 1:134-144)**
  > Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) represents a paradigm shift, intended to address and overcome the inherent limitations of traditional case-centric process mining methods. OCPM starts from the actual events and objects that leave traces in ERP, CRM, MES, and other IT systems.

---

### 107. Flattening-Based Process Discovery Approach

Hybrid methodology bridging object-centric and traditional process mining. Flattening projects multi-entity event logs to single-case logs by selecting an object type, enabling application of established discovery algorithms (alpha miner, inductive miner). Results for different object types are then collated into unified object-centric models.

**Sources**:

- **10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:555-562)**
  > A flattening operation transforms the object-centric event log into a traditional event log given the choice of an object type. This is useful because many process mining approaches are only available for traditional event logs.

---

### 108. Formal Definition with Mathematical Foundations

Top-down formal methodology using set-theoretic definitions. Object-centric event logs are rigorously defined as mathematical tuples with explicit universes (events, attributes, object types), typing functions, and total orderings. This mathematical formalization enables precise semantics and formal proofs about log properties.

**Sources**:

- **10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:448-451)**
  > An object-centric event log is a tuple L = (E, AN, AV, AT, OT, O, πtyp, πact, πtime, πvmap, πomap, πotyp, πovmap, ≤) such that...

---

### 109. OC-DFG Discovery Through Collation

Compositional discovery methodology. Object-centric directly-follows multigraphs (OC-DFGs) are discovered by: (1) flattening log per object type, (2) discovering DFG per flattened log, (3) collating results. This leverages existing algorithms while producing richer multi-perspective models.

**Sources**:

- **10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 1:788-791)**
  > Essentially, the event log is flattened for each object type, the operation of discovery of an object-centric directly-follows multigraph is performed for each flattened log and the results are collated together to obtain the OC-DFG.

---

### 110. Model-Independent Conformance Checking

Empirical methodology for conformance checking that does not require reference models. Rules like CC1 (number of objects per activity) and CC2 (lifecycle duration) verify properties directly on event logs using statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) to identify anomalies. This bottom-up approach discovers violations from data patterns.

**Sources**:

- **10-OC-PM_Object-Centric_Process_Mining (Chunk 2:65-68)**
  > As the last technique, we describe some approaches for conformance checking which are independent of a process model and depend solely on the verification of properties on the event log.

---

### 111. Local Directly-Follows Relation Per Entity

Novel methodology avoiding convergence/divergence problems by defining directly-follows relations per individual entity rather than per global case. Events remain local to their correlated entities, and temporal ordering only connects actually related events. This preserves behavioral accuracy lost in classical flattening approaches.

**Sources**:

- **11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:511-516)**
  > We can avoid both problems by simply not extracting all events towards a single case identifier, but keeping all events local to the entities they are directly correlated to. To analyze behavior, we only construct a temporal order between events that are related, e.g., correlated to the same entity.

---

### 112. Event Knowledge Graph Construction Method

Bottom-up methodology for constructing event knowledge graphs from event tables. Three-step process: (1) translate event records to nodes, (2) infer entity nodes and correlation edges from entity identifier attributes, (3) infer df-relationships for each entity based on temporal ordering of correlated events. Uses labeled property graph formalism.

**Sources**:

- **11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:693-703)**
  > We obtain an event knowledge graph from an event table T in three steps. 1. Create an event node for each event record. 2. Infer entities and correlation relationships from event attributes. 3. Infer directly-follows relationships between all events with a corr relationship to the same entity node.

---

### 113. Derived Entity Reification for Interaction Discovery

Methodology for discovering inter-entity behavioral dependencies. Relations between entity types are reified into derived entities, events correlated to either original entity become correlated to the derived entity, and df-relationships for derived entities reveal interaction paths. This surfaces behavioral dependencies not visible in single-entity perspectives.

**Sources**:

- **11-Process_Mining_Event_Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:893-905)**
  > We reify the relation between two entity types ent1 and ent2 into a new derived entity type (ent1, ent2). That is, we make each pair (n1, n2) an entity node...An event e is then correlated to a derived entity (n1, n2) iff e is correlated to n1 or n2 (or both).
