- name: Endurant Definition - Time-Persistence
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:283-288)
    quote: Endurants are individuals that exist in time with all their parts. They
      have essential and accidental properties and, hence, they can qualitatively
      change while maintaining their numerical identity
  description: UFO defines endurants as entities that exist wholly at any moment they
    exist, possessing both essential and accidental properties. This allows endurants
    to undergo qualitative change while preserving numerical identity. The identity
    persistence is governed by the unique Kind the endurant instantiates.
- name: Perdurant Definition - Temporal Unfolding
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:289-296)
    quote: Perdurants are individuals that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts.
      They are manifestations of dispositions and only exist in the past. As such,
      perdurants are modally fragile
  description: Perdurants (events) are defined as entities that accumulate temporal
    parts as they unfold in time. They are manifestations of dispositions and exist
    only in the past. Being modally fragile means there is no cross-world identity
    between perdurants - they cannot be different than what they are.
- name: Substantial Definition - Independent Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:298-301)
    quote: accounting for both substantial individuals (or Substantials), i.e., independent
      entities (e.g., Mick Jagger, the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano)
  description: Substantials are defined as independent entities that do not existentially
    depend on other entities for their existence. Examples include persons and organizations.
    Substantials contrast with moments (existentially dependent entities).
- name: Moment Definition - Existentially Dependent Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:299-301)
    quote: particularized properties, i.e., existentially dependent entities or moments,
      these last ones termed aspects, abstract particulars, or variable tropes
  description: Moments are defined as particularized properties that are existentially
    dependent on other entities. They are parasitic entities that can only exist by
    inhering in other entities. Also known as aspects, abstract particulars, or variable
    tropes in philosophical literature.
- name: Quality Definition - Projectable Property
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:302-306)
    quote: Intrinsic moments are existentially dependent on a single individual. These
      include qualities, i.e., reifications of categorical properties such as color,
      height, weight, electrical charge
  description: Qualities are intrinsic moments that can be directly projected into
    certain value spaces. They are reifications of categorical properties (color,
    height, weight, electrical charge). Qualities map to quality structures which
    delimit the space of possible values (qualia).
- name: Quality Structure Definition - Value Space
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:303-306)
    quote: The latter, termed quality structures, are abstract entities delimiting
      the space of possible values (qualia, singular quale) for qualities of a given
      quality type
  description: Quality structures are abstract entities that define the space of possible
    values (qualia) for qualities of a given quality type. They can be one-dimensional
    (quality dimensions like height, weight) or composed of multiple co-dependent
    dimensions (quality domains like color spindle, taste tetrahedron).
- name: Mode Definition - Non-Projectable Intrinsic Moment
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-323)
    quote: Intrinsic moments also include modes. Modes can bear their own moments,
      including their own qualities, which can vary in independent ways
  description: Modes are intrinsic moments that cannot be projected into a value space
    (unlike qualities). They include dispositions (functions, capabilities, capacities,
    vulnerabilities) and externally dependent entities. Modes can bear their own moments,
    including qualities that vary independently.
- name: Disposition Definition - Modal Capacity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:321-323)
    quote: The category of modes include dispositions (e.g., functions, capabilities,
      capacities, vulnerabilities)
  description: Dispositions are a type of mode that represents capacities, functions,
    capabilities, and vulnerabilities of entities. They are intrinsic moments that
    connect to events through manifestation - a perdurant manifests a disposition
    inhering in an endurant.
- name: Externally Dependent Mode Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:323-327)
    quote: Externally dependent modes inhere in an entity while being externally dependent
      on another entity
  description: 'Externally dependent modes are modes that inhere in one entity while
    being existentially dependent on another entity that is mereologically disjoint
    from the bearer. Example: John''s love for Mary inheres in John but depends on
    Mary''s existence.'
- name: Qua Individual Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:325-329)
    quote: a qua individual, which is a mode composed of other externally dependent
      modes that share the same bearer, the same source of external dependence, and
      the same foundational event
  description: 'A qua individual is a complex mode composed of externally dependent
    modes that share: (1) the same bearer, (2) the same source of external dependence,
    and (3) the same foundational event. Example: John-qua-husband-of-Mary represents
    all commitments and claims John has towards Mary founded in their wedding.'
- name: Relator Definition - Aggregated Qua Individuals
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:329-334)
    quote: a relator is a moment (i.e., an existentially dependent entity) that is
      an aggregation of qua individuals
  description: A relator is a moment that aggregates qua individuals, thereby being
    existentially dependent on multiple individuals (the bearers of its constituting
    qua individuals). Examples include marriages, enrollments, employments, contracts,
    and presidential mandates. Relators serve as truthmarkers of material relations.
- name: Object Definition - Functional Complex
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:360-361)
    quote: Objects (aka functional complexes) are entities whose parts play differentiated
      functional roles with respect to the whole
  description: Objects (functional complexes) are substantials whose parts play differentiated
    functional roles with respect to the whole. Examples include human bodies, organizations,
    computers, and cars. This distinguishes objects from quantities and collectives
    which have different unity conditions.
- name: Collective Definition - Uniform Parts
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:356-358)
    quote: Collectives are entities whose parts play the same role with respect to
      the whole
  description: Collectives are substantials whose parts play the same role with respect
    to the whole. Examples include the Black Forest (as a collective of trees), a
    deck of cards, and the Dutch-speaking group in a crowd. This uniform part-role
    distinguishes collectives from objects.
- name: Quantity Definition - Homeomerous Matter
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:353-355)
    quote: Quantities are maximally-topologically-self-connected (e.g., pieces) of
      homeomerous amounts of matter
  description: Quantities are substantials that are maximally topologically self-connected
    portions of homeomerous (uniform) amounts of matter. Examples include 'that puddle
    of water' and 'this particular pile of sand'. This topological connectivity defines
    their unity conditions.
- name: Kind Definition - Identity Principle Provider
  sources:

    quote: a kind, which provides uniform principles of individuation, identity, and
      persistence to its instances
  description: 'A Kind is a fundamental sort of endurant type that provides uniform
    principles of individuation, identity, and persistence to its instances. Examples:
    person, dog, computer, car, headache, organization, marriage. Kinds apply necessarily
    to their instances in all possible situations (rigid types).'
- name: Sortal Definition - Kind Specialization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:369-370)
    quote: A sortal is either a kind or a specialization of a kind, and every sortal
      that is not a kind specializes exactly one kind
  description: A sortal is either a kind or a specialization of exactly one kind.
    Sortals provide identity conditions for their instances. Every endurant necessarily
    instantiates exactly one kind, ensuring identity principle uniqueness.
- name: Subkind Definition - Rigid Specialization
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:371-372)
    quote: These specializations can be either themselves rigid, in which case they
      are termed subkinds
  description: Subkinds are rigid specializations of kinds that apply necessarily
    to their instances. Examples include hatchback car (subkind of car) and financial
    organization (subkind of organization). Subkinds inherit the identity principle
    from their parent kind.
- name: Phase Definition - Intrinsic Contingent Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:373-375)
    quote: sortals whose contingent classification conditions are intrinsic, termed
      Phases (e.g., teenager as a phase of person, hemorrhagic dengue fever as a phase
      of dengue fever)
  description: 'Phases are anti-rigid sortals whose contingent classification conditions
    are intrinsic (internal to the entity). Examples: teenager as a phase of person,
    tenured employment as a phase of employment. Phases represent states or stages
    in an entity''s lifecycle.'
- name: Role Definition - Relational Contingent Classification
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:375-377)
    quote: sortals whose contingent classification conditions are relational, termed
      roles (e.g., employee as a role of a person in the scope of an employment relator)
  description: 'Roles are anti-rigid sortals whose contingent classification conditions
    are relational (depend on relationships with other entities). Examples: employee
    (role of person in employment relator scope), husband (role of person in marriage
    relator scope). Roles emerge from relator mediation.'
- name: Category Definition - Rigid Non-Sortal
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:381-383)
    quote: 'categories: rigid types that define essential properties for their instances,
      e.g., the category ''physical object'' describing the properties of having a
      mass and a spatial extension'
  description: 'Categories are rigid non-sortals that define essential properties
    for instances of multiple kinds. Example: ''physical object'' describes properties
    (mass, spatial extension) common to kinds like car, person, bridge, cow. Categories
    abstract over different identity principles.'

    quote: 'phase mixins: anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their
      instances. Their instantiation is characterized by intrinsic contingent conditions'
  description: 'Phase mixins are anti-rigid non-sortals whose instantiation depends
    on intrinsic contingent conditions. Examples: ''living animal'' (applies to instances
    of person, dog, horse), ''functional device'' (applies to instances of computer,
    watch, espresso machine). Phase mixins cross kind boundaries.'

    quote: 'role mixins: anti-rigid types that define contingent properties for their
      instances. Their instantiation is characterized by relational contingent conditions'
  description: 'Role mixins are anti-rigid non-sortals whose instantiation depends
    on relational contingent conditions. Examples: ''customer'' for kinds person and
    organization, ''insured legal relator'' for kinds employment and enrollment. Role
    mixins abstract role patterns across different kinds.'

    quote: 'mixins: semi-rigid types that define properties that are essential to
      some of their instances but accidental to some other instances'
  description: 'Mixins are semi-rigid non-sortals whose properties are essential to
    some instances but accidental to others. Example: being a ''music artist'' is
    essential to bands but accidental to people. Mixins represent properties that
    cross the essential/accidental boundary.'
- name: Type Definition - Possibly Instantiated
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:454-455)
    quote: types are implicitly defined as those entities that are possibly instantiated
  description: Types are formally defined as entities that are possibly instantiated
    (there exists some possible world where something instantiates them). This distinguishes
    types from individuals, which are entities that are necessarily not instantiated
    by anything.
- name: Individual Definition - Not Instantiable
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:454-458)
    quote: while individuals are those necessarily not instantiated
  description: Individuals are formally defined as entities that are necessarily not
    instantiated - nothing can be an instance of an individual. The domain is partitioned

    (endurants, perdurants) and abstract individuals.
- name: Concrete Individual Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:507-509)
    quote: Among the individuals, there are concrete individuals (a7) and abstract
      individuals (a8)-(a10). Concrete individuals are further differentiated into
      endurants (a11) and perdurants (a12)
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:507-509)
    quote: concrete individuals (a7) and abstract individuals (a8)-(a10)
  description: Merged from 2 sources. Concrete individuals are the primary partition
    of individuals, opposed to abstract individuals. Concrete individuals are exhaustively
    partitioned into endurants (entities wholly present at any time they exist) and
    perdurants (entities that unfold in time accumulating temporal parts).
- name: Rigid Type Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 1:557-562)
    quote: We implicitly define rigidity of endurant types as rigid (a18), anti-rigid
      (a19) and semi-rigid (a20)
  description: Rigid types are endurant types where if an entity possibly instantiates
    the type, it necessarily instantiates it in all possible worlds where it exists.
    Rigid types include kinds, subkinds, and categories. A rigid type cannot specialize
    an anti-rigid one.

      is either one of the three
  description: Anti-rigid types are endurant types where if an entity possibly instantiates
    the type, it can possibly not instantiate it. Anti-rigid types include phases,
    roles, phase mixins, and role mixins. These represent contingent classifications.
- name: Inherence Definition - Moment-Bearer Relation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 2:129-139)
    quote: The relation that connects moments to the object that they are about is
      the relation of inherence. Inherence is a type of existential dependence relation
  description: Inherence is the relation connecting moments to their bearers. It is
    a type of existential dependence (the moment depends on the bearer for existence).
    Inherence is non-reflexive, asymmetric, and anti-transitive. A moment cannot inhere
    in two separate individuals (non-migration principle).
- name: Ultimate Bearer Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 2:156-158)
    quote: Moments can also be involved in chains of inherence relations, which are
      ultimately grounded on a unique entity that does not inhere in anything else.
      This entity that we will call here the Ultimate Bearer
  description: The ultimate bearer is the unique entity at the end of inherence chains
    that does not itself inhere in anything else. Every moment has exactly one ultimate
    bearer. This grounds moment hierarchies (moments of moments) in non-moment entities.

  description: 'A qua individual of entity y is formally the mereological sum of all
    externally dependent modes of y that share the same foundational event. Example:
    John-qua-husband-of-Mary sums all conjugal commitments of John founded on the

  description: 'A relator is formally defined as the sum of qua individuals that share
    the same foundation and are mutually existentially dependent. Relators have at
    least two distinct qua individuals as proper parts. Example: Marriage relator
    contains John-qua-husband and Mary-qua-wife.'

    quote: We introduce the relation of mediation, mediates(x, y), between a relator
      x and an individual y that the relator connects in a relational statement
  description: Mediation is the relation between a relator and the individuals it
    connects. A relator mediates an endurant when a qua individual of that endurant
    is part of the relator. Every relator mediates at least two distinct individuals
    (theorem t33).
- name: Characterization Definition
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 2:302-306)
    quote: a type is characterized by moment types that inhere in its instances
  description: Characterization is the relation between an endurant type and moment
    types that necessarily inhere in its instances. If type t is characterized by
    moment type m, then every instance of t has exactly one moment of type m inhering
    in it, and every moment of type m inheres in exactly one instance of t.

  sources:

    quote: As for any quality, a Flower Color quality inheres in its bearer (the characterization
      relation). A perceivable quality takes its value in a color domain
  description: UFO defines Quality as a type of moment (dependent entity) that inheres
    in a bearer and takes values from a quality structure. Unlike tropes in the classical
    sense, qualities are 'variable tropes' - they can change their values while maintaining
    identity. This relates to the 8-entity hypothesis by grounding how Data/attributes
    attach to entities.
- name: Inherence as Existential Dependence
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:82-85)
    quote: inherence is an existential dependence relation and, hence, the connection
      between a particular quality and its bearer is immutable
  description: Inherence in UFO is defined as existential dependence - a quality cannot
    exist without its bearer, and this connection is immutable. However, the hasValue
    relation between a quality and its value (qualia) is generic dependence, allowing
    change. This pattern is fundamental for understanding how properties attach to
    entities.
- name: Event as Modally Fragile Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:103-107)
    quote: In UFO, we follow a classical view of events in which events are modally
      fragile entities. So, events cannot bear modal properties, they cannot genuinely
      change
  description: UFO defines Events as modally fragile entities that cannot genuinely
    change - they are fixed once they occur. Events are polygenic manifestations of
    dispositions. This formal definition distinguishes Events from Endurants (which
    can change) in the 8-entity framework.
- name: Role as Externally Dependent Mode
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:129-131)
    quote: Jogger is a role played by a Person when bearing a Jog mode (an endurant

  description: UFO defines Role as a pattern where an entity (like Person) plays a
    Role (like Jogger) by bearing a Mode that comprises intentional states and capacities.
    This grounds the Role entity type in the 8-entity hypothesis through the mode-bearing
    relationship.

    quote: At each situation, we have a particular type of maximal Jogging Process...that
      is constituted by (exactly) the sum of Jogging Events that are manifestations
      of that Jog
  description: UFO defines Process as the 'life' of an endurant - constituted by all
    Events that manifest the endurant's dispositions. This recursive definition connects
    Events to ongoing Processes through constitution and manifestation relations.
- name: Event Partition into States and Locomotions
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:186-191)
    quote: Jogging Events can be stative/homeomerous and some are dynamic/sequences

      have Jogging Locomotion
  description: UFO partitions Events into stative (homeomerous) and dynamic types.
    Stative events maintain uniform properties throughout; dynamic events involve
    sequences of changes. Events are characterized by tropes (immutable properties)
    rather than variable qualities.

    quote: a Walk is modeled as an externally dependent mode that inheres in the Walker
      and that is externally dependent on Place (that plays the role of an originally
      intended destination)
  description: UFO defines complex Modes that have both inherence (to their bearer)
    and external dependence (on other entities like destinations). This pattern captures
    intentional actions with Goals - relating to Goal entity in the 8-entity hypothesis.
- name: Relator as Social Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:412-416)
    quote: We observe that what remains stable here is a general kind of relator we
      call Conjugal Relationship between Spouses. Varying constraints established
      in the social process in time lead to specific types
  description: UFO defines Relator as a social entity that mediates between other
    entities. Relators can have types that evolve over time while maintaining core
    identity. This grounds social/organizational relationships in the ontology.
- name: Higher-Order Type (Powertype)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 01-UFO (Chunk 3:419-424)
    quote: UFO captures this scenario by accounting not only for the individuals in
      the domain of inquiry but types as well. This leads to higher-order types, i.e.,
      types whose instances are themselves types
  description: UFO supports higher-order types (metatypes) where instances are themselves
    types. This powertype pattern enables modeling concept evolution and type hierarchies,
    supporting flexible metamodeling for the UDWO framework.

    quote: we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and
      convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest
      and whose edges represent relations between these entities
  description: Formal definition of knowledge graph as a graph where nodes represent
    entities and edges represent relations. The graph conforms to a data model (directed
    edge-labelled, property graph, etc.) and aims to capture real-world knowledge.
    This is the foundational entity definition for KG-based systems.
- name: Entity Definition in KG Context
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:77-81)
    quote: Graphs provide a concise and intuitive abstraction for a variety of domains,
      where edges capture the (potentially cyclical) relations between the entities
      inherent in social data, biological interactions
  description: In knowledge graphs, Entity is defined as a node representing a real-world
    thing (person, place, concept). Entities are connected by Relations (edges) that
    can be cyclical. This basic Entity-Relation pattern underlies all KG representations.
- name: Directed Edge-Labelled Graph Model
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:404-408)
    quote: A directed edge-labelled graph (also known as a multi-relational graph)
      is defined as a set of nodes...and a set of directed labelled edges between
      those nodes
  description: 'Formal definition of directed edge-labelled graph: nodes represent
    entities, directed labelled edges represent binary relations. This is the foundational
    data model for RDF and many knowledge graphs, defining how Entity and Relation
    are technically represented.'
- name: Heterogeneous Graph with Node Types
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:483-490)
    quote: A heterogeneous graph (or heterogeneous information network) is a graph
      where each node and edge is assigned one type
  description: Heterogeneous graphs extend the basic model by assigning explicit types
    to nodes and edges. This supports Entity typing (homogeneous vs heterogeneous
    edges) and enables type-based partitioning for machine learning. Directly relates
    to entity_types field.
- name: Property Graph Model
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:548-551)
    quote: The property graph model was thus proposed to offer additional flexibility
      when modelling data as a graph. A property graph allows a set of property-value
      pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges
  description: Property graphs allow property-value pairs on nodes AND edges, with
    labels for typing. This extends Entity definition to include attributes, and allows
    Relations (edges) to carry metadata. Used in Neo4j and commercial graph databases.
- name: Graph Dataset with Named Graphs
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:583-598)
    quote: A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph.
      Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph
  description: Graph datasets organize multiple graphs with identifiers. Named graphs
    enable provenance tracking, source management, and context scoping. This pattern
    is essential for multi-source knowledge graph integration.
- name: Class Definition in Semantic Schema
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 1:1000-1001)
    quote: A semantic schema allows for defining the meaning of high-level terms (aka
      vocabulary or terminology) used in the graph
  description: Semantic schema defines Classes as groupings of entities sharing common
    characteristics. Classes form hierarchies (subclass relations) and are used to
    type entities. This grounds the abstract entity taxonomy in concrete schema definitions.
- name: Class Hierarchy with Subclass
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:113-118)
    quote: In Figure 11, we present a class hierarchy for events where children are
      defined to be subclasses of their parents such that if we find an edge EID15
      type Food Festival...we may also infer that EID15 type Festival
  description: Classes are organized in hierarchies where subclass relations enable
    inference. If X is instance of subclass, X is also instance of superclass. This
    taxonomic pattern is fundamental for entity classification and type reasoning.
- name: Property with Domain and Range
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:127-131)
    quote: We may further define the domain of properties, indicating the class(es)
      of entities for nodes from which edges with that property extend
  description: Properties (relations) have domain and range constraints defining valid
    entity types for subject and object positions. Domain specifies source entity
    type; range specifies target entity type. This constrains valid Entity-Relation-Entity
    patterns.
- name: Open World Assumption (OWA)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:192-210)
    quote: A consequence of CWA is that the addition of an edge to the data graph
      may contradict what was previously assumed to be false, whereas with OWA, a
      statement that is proven false continues to be false
  description: 'Under OWA, absence of an edge does not mean the relation is false
    - only that it is unknown. This assumption affects entity and relation definitions:
    entities may have unknown properties. Contrasts with CWA where unknown = false.'
- name: Shape as Validation Constraint
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:251-260)
    quote: A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints
      on those nodes. The shape's target can be defined in many ways
  description: Shapes define constraints on entities (nodes). A shape targets entities
    (by class, property, query) and specifies required/optional properties, cardinalities,
    and value types. This validates whether entities conform to expected definitions.
- name: Quotient Graph as Schema Summary
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:439-448)
    quote: A framework often used for defining emergent schema is that of quotient
      graphs, which partition groups of nodes in the data graph according to some
      equivalence relation
  description: Quotient graphs partition entities into equivalence classes based on
    structural similarity. The quotient graph summarizes entity types and their relationships,
    providing an emergent schema from data. This connects bottom-up entity discovery
    to schema definition.
- name: Persistent Identifier (PID) for Entity
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:562-567)
    quote: To avoid such clashes, long-lasting persistent identifiers (PIDs) can be
      created in order to uniquely identify an entity. Prominent examples of PID schemes
      include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
  description: Entities require unique persistent identifiers to avoid naming clashes
    across knowledge graphs. PIDs (DOIs, IRIs, ORCIDs) provide global identity. This
    is fundamental for entity disambiguation and cross-graph integration.
- name: IRI as Entity Identifier
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:585-594)
    quote: RDF 1.1 proposes to use Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) to
      identify non-information resources such as cities or events
  description: IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) identify real-world entities
    distinctly from URLs (which identify documents about entities). This separation
    prevents confusion between entity and description, essential for precise entity
    definition.
- name: Identity Link (owl:sameAs)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:687-694)
    quote: identity links to state that a local entity has the same identity as another
      coreferent entity found in an external source; an instantiation of this concept
      can be found in the OWL standard, which defines the owl:sameAs property
  description: Identity links (owl:sameAs) assert that two nodes refer to the same
    real-world entity. This enables entity resolution across knowledge graphs and
    is essential for data integration where the same Entity has different identifiers.
- name: Datatype Value as Entity Property
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:712-721)
    quote: Most practical data models for graphs allow for defining nodes that are
      datatype values. RDF utilises XML Schema Datatypes (XSD)
  description: Entities can have datatype values (strings, integers, dates) as property
    values. These are distinct from entity nodes - they represent Data/values rather
    than real-world things. Datatype nodes cannot have outgoing edges in RDF.
- name: Lexicalized Entity with Labels
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:748-753)
    quote: Since identifiers can be arbitrary, it is common to add edges that provide
      a human-interpretable label for nodes, such as wd:Q2887 rdfs:label 'Santiago'
  description: Entities have human-readable labels (rdfs:label) separate from their
    identifiers. Labels may be multilingual. Lexicalized knowledge graphs support
    entity grounding through natural language labels for human interpretation and
    NLP integration.
- name: Existential Node (Blank Node)
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:779-798)
    quote: some graph models permit the use of existential nodes...These edges denote
      that there exists a common venue for chile:EID42 and chile:EID42 without identifying
      it
  description: Existential nodes (blank nodes in RDF) represent entities known to
    exist but without assigned identifiers. They assert existence without identity,
    useful for modeling incomplete knowledge about entities.
- name: Context as Scope of Truth
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 2:833-837)
    quote: By context we herein refer to the scope of truth, and thus talk about the
      context in which some data are held to be true
  description: Context defines the scope in which entity properties/relations hold
    true. Context includes temporal (when), geographic (where), and provenance (source)
    dimensions. Entities and their relations may be context-dependent.
- name: Temporal Context Annotation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 3:111-117)
    quote: Temporal RDF allows for annotating edges with time intervals, such as Chile
      [2006,2010] M. Bachelet, while Fuzzy RDF allows for annotating edges with a
      degree of truth
  description: Temporal annotations specify when relations between entities hold.
    Time intervals constrain validity of edges. Similarly, fuzzy annotations provide
    confidence degrees. This extends Entity-Relation model with context/confidence
    metadata.
- name: Annotated RDF with Semi-rings
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 3:120-126)
    quote: 'Annotated RDF allows for representing various forms of context modelled
      as semi-rings: algebraic structures consisting of domain values...and two main
      operators to combine domain values: meet and join'
  description: Annotated RDF uses algebraic semi-ring structures to model contextual
    domains. Meet combines conjunctive context (intersection); join combines disjunctive
    context (union). This formal framework supports reasoning about entity properties
    in context.
- name: Ontology as Formal Representation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-KG (Chunk 3:311-313)
    quote: In the context of computing, an ontology is then a concrete, formal representation
      of what terms mean within the scope in which they are used
  description: Ontology provides formal definitions of entity types, their properties,
    and relationships. It defines what terms (entity names, relation names) mean in
    a specific domain. This is the meta-level definition that grounds all entity definitions.
- name: Interpretation Mapping Terms to Domain
  sources:

    quote: 'we can abstractly define an interpretation of a data graph as being composed
      of two elements: a domain graph, and a mapping from the terms (nodes and edge-labels)
      of the data graph to those of the domain graph'
  description: Interpretation maps graph terms (nodes, edge labels) to domain entities
    and relations. This formal semantics defines how syntactic entities in the graph
    correspond to real-world things. Essential for understanding entity semantics.

    value from' (existential), 'all values from' (universal), 'has value' (specific
    value), cardinality restrictions constrain entity membership based on their relational
    patterns.
- name: Rule as Inference Pattern
