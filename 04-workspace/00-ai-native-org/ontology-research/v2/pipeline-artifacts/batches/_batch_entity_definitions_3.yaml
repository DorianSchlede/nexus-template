patterns:
  - name: "W3C PROV Agent Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:200-204)"
    quote: "W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process)"
    description: "The foundational W3C PROV model defines three core classes: Agent (software or human actors responsible for activities), Entity (data), and Activity (process). Agents represent either software or human actors responsible for activities. This forms the core Agent-Activity-Entity triad that PROV-AGENT extends."

  - name: "AIAgent as PROV Agent Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:278-284)"
    quote: "We extend the abstract W3C PROV Agent by modeling AIAgent as its subclass, enabling a natural integration of agent actions and interactions into the broader workflow provenance graph"
    description: "AIAgent is formally defined as a subclass of the W3C PROV Agent class. This enables AI agents to be first-class citizens in provenance graphs alongside traditional workflow components. The model supports multi-agentic workflows with multiple AI agents, each with their own tools and reasoning paths, enabling representation of collaborative or parallel agent behaviors."

  - name: "AgentTool Definition (MCP-Derived)"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-286)"
    quote: "Following the MCP terminology, an AI agent can be associated with one or many tool executions (AgentTool)"
    description: "AgentTool is defined as a tool execution activity associated with an AIAgent. Based on MCP (Model Context Protocol) terminology, each tool may be informed by one or many AIModelInvocations. This creates the link between agent actions and the underlying model reasoning that drives them."

  - name: "AIModelInvocation Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:287-296)"
    quote: "Each AIModelInvocation uses a Prompt and a specific AIModel, which holds model metadata, including its name, type, provider, temperature, and other parameters, and generates a ResponseData object"
    description: "AIModelInvocation is defined as an activity that represents a single invocation of an AI model. It uses a Prompt, is linked to an AIModel (containing metadata), and generates a ResponseData object. The ResponseData is attributed to the corresponding agent. The model is modality-agnostic, supporting LLMs, vision models, audio models, and multimodal reasoning systems."

  - name: "AIModel Metadata Entity"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:289-291)"
    quote: "AIModel, which holds model metadata, including its name, type, provider, temperature, and other parameters"
    description: "AIModel is defined as an entity that holds model metadata including: name, type, provider, temperature, and other parameters. This provides the structural metadata needed to understand which model was used for any given invocation and with what configuration."

  - name: "Campaign as PROV Activity Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:263-265)"
    quote: "Campaign, Workflow, and Task, modeled as subclasses of PROV Activities. Campaigns are associated with Person or Organization agents via wasAssociatedWith"
    description: "Campaign is defined as a subclass of PROV Activity that represents a higher-level organizational unit in workflow provenance. Campaigns are associated with Person or Organization agents via the PROV wasAssociatedWith relationship, establishing responsibility and attribution."

  - name: "Workflow as PROV Activity Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:263-264)"
    quote: "Campaign, Workflow, and Task, modeled as subclasses of PROV Activities"
    description: "Workflow is defined as a subclass of PROV Activity that represents a complete workflow in the provenance model. This sits between Campaign (higher-level) and Task (lower-level) in the workflow structure hierarchy."

  - name: "Task as PROV Activity Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:263-267)"
    quote: "Tasks consume (PROV used) and produce (PROV generated) domain-specific data objects (DomainData)"
    description: "Task is defined as a subclass of PROV Activity that represents individual computational tasks. Tasks consume data via the PROV 'used' relationship and produce data via the PROV 'generated' relationship. They also generate SchedulingData (where the task ran) and TelemetryData (runtime metrics)."

  - name: "DataObject as PROV Entity Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:274-276)"
    quote: "These data, modeled as subclasses of DataObject, which is a subclass of PROV Entity, enrich the provenance graph with infrastructure-level context"
    description: "DataObject is defined as a subclass of PROV Entity that serves as the base class for all data artifacts in the provenance model. It provides the foundation for DomainData, SchedulingData, TelemetryData, Prompt, and ResponseData subclasses."

  - name: "DomainData Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:265-267)"
    quote: "Typically, in a provenance graph, they contain parameters, arguments, KPIs, QoIs, and pointers to domain data files or data objects stored elsewhere"
    description: "DomainData is defined as a subclass of DataObject representing domain-specific data objects. These contain parameters, arguments, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Quality of Indicators (QoIs), and pointers to domain data files or objects stored elsewhere. Examples include Experiment_Setup, Sensor_Data, Control_Result, and Scores."

  - name: "SchedulingData Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:271-273)"
    quote: "SchedulingData contains where the task ran, including details such as compute node, CPU core, or GPU ID"
    description: "SchedulingData is defined as a subclass of DataObject that contains execution location metadata. This includes details such as compute node, CPU core, or GPU ID. It provides infrastructure-level context for understanding where in the distributed environment (edge, cloud, HPC) a task executed."

  - name: "TelemetryData Definition"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:273-277)"
    quote: "TelemetryData contains runtime metrics such as CPU and GPU usage, and disk usage"
    description: "TelemetryData is defined as a subclass of DataObject that contains runtime performance metrics. This includes CPU usage, GPU usage, disk usage, and other telemetry. These data enrich the provenance graph with infrastructure-level context needed for traceability and performance analysis."

  - name: "Prompt as DataObject Subclass"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:288-289)"
    quote: "Each AIModelInvocation uses a Prompt and a specific AIModel"
    description: "Prompt is defined as a subclass of DataObject that represents the input prompt to an AI model invocation. Prompts are consumed (PROV 'used') by AIModelInvocation activities. In the context of RAG strategies, prompts may be dynamically augmented with contextual knowledge from various data sources."

  - name: "ResponseData Definition with Attribution"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:290-292)"
    quote: "generates a ResponseData object, which is attributedTo the corresponding agent"
    description: "ResponseData is defined as a subclass of DataObject representing the response/output from an AI model invocation. Critically, ResponseData is linked to the agent via the PROV 'wasAttributedTo' relationship, establishing clear attribution of AI-generated content to the responsible agent."

  - name: "Entity Relationship: wasInformedBy for Agent Tools"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:286-287)"
    quote: "each tool may be informed by (PROV wasInformedBy) one or many AIModelInvocations"
    description: "The relationship between AgentTool and AIModelInvocation is defined using the PROV 'wasInformedBy' relationship. This captures how tool executions depend on the results of model invocations for their decision-making and reasoning."

  - name: "Entity Relationship: wasAttributedTo for Agent Outputs"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:301-303)"
    quote: "When instances of subclasses of DataObject are generated by agent tools, they are attributed to (wasAttributedTo) the instance of the agent"
    description: "All data generated by agent tools is linked back to the agent via the PROV 'wasAttributedTo' relationship. This includes ResponseData and other DataObject subclasses, establishing clear provenance and accountability for AI-generated artifacts."
