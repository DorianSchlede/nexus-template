patterns:
  - name: "PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV standard"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:117-121)"
    quote: "PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends the W3C PROV standard and incorporates concepts from the Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
    description: "PROV-AGENT is positioned as a formal extension of W3C PROV. The extension adds AI agent-specific concepts including tools, prompts, responses, and model invocations while maintaining compatibility with the W3C standard. This demonstrates how foundational provenance ontologies can be extended for new domains like agentic AI."

  - name: "W3C PROV Agent-Activity-Entity triad alignment"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:197-204)"
    quote: "the W3C PROV standard already defines Agent, the central abstraction in this work, as one of its three core classes, alongside Entity (data) and Activity (process)"
    description: "The paper explicitly validates the Agent-Activity-Entity triad from W3C PROV as the foundational structure. Agents represent software or human actors responsible for activities. This aligns with the research hypothesis about the universality of the Agent-Activity-Entity pattern across foundational ontologies."

  - name: "PROV-DfA comparison for human-steered workflows"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:212-214)"
    quote: "PROV-DfA extends PROV to capture human actions in human-steered workflows, while ProvONE adds workflow-specific metadata"
    description: "Framework comparison showing PROV-DfA extends PROV for human-in-the-loop scenarios, while ProvONE extends it for workflow management systems. PROV-AGENT differentiates itself by focusing on AI agent actions rather than human actions, filling a gap in the PROV extension landscape."

  - name: "ProvONE workflow metadata extension"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:214-216)"
    quote: "ProvONE adds workflow-specific metadata and aims at supporting existing workflow management systems"
    description: "ProvONE is identified as a PROV extension for workflow management systems. It adds workflow-specific metadata but lacks semantics for agentic behavior. This positions ProvONE as a domain extension while PROV-AGENT adds agent-centric semantics."

  - name: "PROV-ML for AI/ML model training"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:240-241)"
    quote: "PROV-ML combines general workflow concepts with ML-specific artifacts, especially for model training and evaluation"
    description: "PROV-ML extends PROV for machine learning workflows, focusing on model training artifacts. The paper notes PROV-ML is orthogonal to PROV-AGENT as it defines complementary concepts rather than representing AI agents that steer workflows. This shows the ecosystem of PROV extensions for different AI use cases."

  - name: "FAIR4ML model-centric approach"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:241-243)"
    quote: "FAIR4ML adopts a model-centric approach to support the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reproducibility (FAIR) principles"
    description: "FAIR4ML is compared as another provenance approach for AI, but focused on FAIR principles for models rather than agent interactions. This framework comparison highlights different objectives: FAIR4ML for model findability/reproducibility vs PROV-AGENT for agent action traceability."

  - name: "Earlier agent PROV extensions predate agentic AI"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:244-246)"
    quote: "Although the W3C PROV has been extended for agents and multi-agent systems, these earlier efforts predate agentic workflows, lacking support for core agentic AI concepts"
    description: "Critical framework gap identification: previous W3C PROV agent extensions (cited as [24], [25]) were designed before modern agentic AI workflows emerged. They lack support for LLM prompts, responses, model invocations, and how agents relate to broader workflows. PROV-AGENT fills this temporal gap."

  - name: "MCP integration with agentic workflow frameworks"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:141-150)"
    quote: "LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, Academy, and CrewAI support multi-agent systems that interact through prompt exchanges... These frameworks support MCP"
    description: "Framework comparison across agentic AI development frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph, Academy, CrewAI). All support MCP (Model Context Protocol) as an emerging standard. PROV-AGENT leverages MCP concepts to ensure compatibility with these frameworks while adding provenance capabilities."

  - name: "MCP standard concepts integration"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:145-150)"
    quote: "MCP defines core agentic AI development concepts, including tools, prompts, resources, context management, and agent-client architecture"
    description: "PROV-AGENT incorporates MCP's core concepts (tools, prompts, resources, context management, agent-client architecture) into its provenance model. This alignment with an emerging industry standard demonstrates how PROV-AGENT bridges foundational ontology (W3C PROV) with practical AI agent standards (MCP)."

  - name: "Static vs dynamic workflow paradigm shift"
    chunk_ref: "03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:163-168)"
    quote: "Existing provenance techniques lack explicit representations of key agent artifacts... They typically model workflows as static graphs, missing the semantics needed to capture agentic behavior, dynamic decisions"
    description: "Framework comparison identifying a paradigm gap: traditional provenance systems model workflows as static graphs while agentic workflows are non-deterministic with dynamic decisions and cyclic behavior. PROV-AGENT addresses this by adding semantics for agent-driven dynamics."

  - name: "Knowledge graph embedding models comparison table"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:12-55)"
    quote: "Table 8. Details for selected knowledge graph embeddings, including the plausibility scoring function for edge"
    description: "Technical comparison of knowledge graph embedding models (TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, RotatE, RESCAL, DistMult, HolE, ComplEx, SimplE, TuckER, etc.). While not directly about ontology frameworks, this comparison shows how different mathematical approaches model entity relationships in knowledge graphs, relevant to understanding entity representation approaches."

  - name: "RecGNN vs NRecGNN graph neural network architectures"
    chunk_ref: "02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 15:385-504)"
    quote: "A recursive graph neural network (RecGNN) is a pair of functions... A non-recursive graph neural network (NRecGNN) with l layers is an l-tuple of functions"
    description: "Comparison of recursive vs non-recursive graph neural network architectures. RecGNNs apply the same aggregation function recursively until fixpoint, while NRecGNNs use different aggregation functions at each layer up to fixed depth. This architectural comparison is relevant to understanding how different AI/ML approaches process graph-structured ontological data."
