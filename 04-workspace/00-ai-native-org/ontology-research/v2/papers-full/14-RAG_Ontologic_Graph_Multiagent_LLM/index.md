# Paper Analysis: Solar White-Light Flares Study

## CRITICAL NOTICE: Paper Mismatch

**This paper does NOT match its filename.** The file is labeled as "14-RAG_Ontologic_Graph_Multiagent_LLM.pdf" but actually contains a solar physics paper about white-light flares.

### Expected Content (per filename)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Ontologic/Ontology concepts
- Knowledge Graphs
- Multiagent LLM systems

### Actual Content
A statistical study of solar white-light flares (WLFs) observed by the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) on the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) at 360 nm wavelength.

## Actual Paper Summary

### Abstract
The paper analyzes 205 major flares (M- and X-class) from October 2022 to May 2023, identifying 49 white-light flares at 360 nm (23.9% occurrence rate). The study investigates physical properties including white-light enhancement, duration, and brightening area.

### Key Findings (Astrophysics Domain)
1. WLF occurrence rate: 23.9% for major flares above M1.0
2. 100% of X-class flares are WLFs at 360 nm
3. Mean WL duration: 10.3 minutes
4. Mean brightening area: 479 arcsec^2
5. WL emission follows Neupert effect (peaks with HXR emission)

| 8-entity hypothesis validation | NONE |

### Recommendation

**ACTION REQUIRED**: This paper should be:
1. Removed from the ontologies research corpus
2. Replaced with the actual paper matching the filename "RAG_Ontologic_Graph_Multiagent_LLM"
3. Re-sourced to find the correct paper about RAG, ontologies, and multiagent LLMs
