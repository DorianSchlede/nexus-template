- name: Node-Edge-Node Triple Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:138-142)
    quote: a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey
      knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and
      whose edges represent relations between these entities
  description: 'The fundamental entity relationship pattern in knowledge graphs: nodes
    represent entities, edges represent relations. This establishes the basic structural
    relationship where entities are connected via typed edges expressing semantic
    relationships.'
- name: Directed Edge-Labelled Graph Model
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:404-408)
    quote: A directed edge-labelled graph (also known as a multi-relational graph)
      is defined as a set of nodes and a set of directed labelled edges between those
      nodes, like [Santa Lucia] city Santiago
  description: Entity relationships are modeled as directed, labeled edges connecting
    source and target nodes. The edge label specifies the relationship type (e.g.,
    'city'), enabling multi-relational semantics.
- name: Binary Relation Pattern
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:395-399)
    quote: By instead adopting a graph data model from the outset, the board could
      forgo the need for an upfront schema, and could define any (binary) relation
      between any pair of entities at any time
  description: Entity relationships are fundamentally binary - connecting exactly
    two entities. This binary relation pattern allows flexible, schema-free definition
    of relationships between entity pairs.
- name: Heterogeneous Graph Entity-Type Assignment
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:483-490)
    quote: A heterogeneous graph (or heterogeneous information network) is a graph
      where each node and edge is assigned one type. Heterogeneous graphs are thus
      akin to del graphs with edge labels corresponding to edge types
  description: Entities and their relationships can be typed, enabling partitioning
    of nodes by entity type. Edges can be homogeneous (between same-type nodes) or
    heterogeneous (between different-type nodes).
- name: Property Graph Edge Attributes
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:548-552)
    quote: The property graph model was thus proposed to offer additional flexibility
      when modelling data as a graph. A property graph allows a set of property-value
      pairs and a label to be associated with both nodes and edges
  description: Entity relationships can carry additional attribute metadata as property-value
    pairs. This extends the basic edge with contextual information about the relationship
    itself.
- name: Named Graph Dataset Structure
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 1:583-609)
    quote: A graph dataset then consists of a set of named graphs and a default graph.
      Each named graph is a pair of a graph ID and a graph... nodes and edges can
      be repeated across graphs, where the same node in different graphs will typically
      refer to the same entity

      additional representations may be embedded in the data graph, or layered above
      it
  description: 'Entity relationships can be enhanced with three key dimensions: schema
    (structural definitions), identity (entity disambiguation), and context (scope
    of truth). These layers add semantic depth to basic relationships.'

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:107-118)

      classes that we would like to capture... we present a class hierarchy for events
      where children are defined to be subclasses of their parents
  description: Hierarchical classification relationship where child classes inherit
    from parent classes. If entity is type Food Festival, it implies entity is also
    type Festival and type Event through subclass inference.
- name: Subproperty Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:120-125)

    quote: We may further define the domain of properties, indicating the class(es)
      of entities for nodes from which edges with that property extend... Conversely,
      we may define the range of properties, indicating the class(es) of entities
      for nodes to which edges with that property extend
  description: Entity relationships constrain entity types at endpoints. Domain specifies
    valid source entity types; range specifies valid target entity types. These constraints
    enable type inference from relationships.
- name: Shape-Based Relationship Validation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:250-277)
    quote: A shape targets a set of nodes in a data graph and specifies constraints
      on those nodes. The shape's target can be defined in many ways... Constraints
      can then be defined on the targetted nodes, such as to restrict the number or
      types of values taken on a given property
  description: Entity relationships can be validated via shape constraints that specify
    cardinality, type requirements, and structural patterns. Shapes define expected
    relationship patterns for entity types.
- name: Quotient Graph Structural Equivalence
  sources:

      some equivalence relation while preserving some structural properties of the
      graph... the nodes of this quotient graph are the partitions of nodes from the
      data graph
  description: Entity relationships can be abstracted via quotient graphs that group
    structurally equivalent entities. Preserves edge connectivity patterns between
    entity partitions.

    quote: To avoid such clashes, long-lasting persistent identifiers (PIDs) can be
      created in order to uniquely identify an entity. Prominent examples of PID schemes
      include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for papers, ORCID iDs for authors
  description: Entity relationships require unique, persistent identifiers to avoid
    naming clashes during graph merging. PIDs ensure entities maintain consistent
    identity across knowledge graph boundaries.
- name: Same-As Identity Link
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 2:686-698)
    quote: A second option is to use identity links to state that a local entity has
      the same identity as another coreferent entity found in an external source;
      an instantiation of this concept can be found in the OWL standard, which defines
      the owl:sameAs property relating coreferent entities
  description: Explicit relationship declaring two entity nodes refer to the same
    real-world entity. Enables entity consolidation across knowledge graphs and data
    integration.

      intervals, fuzzy values, etc.) and two main operators to combine domain values:
      meet and join'

      being a Food Festival entails that x is a Festival, or that x having venue y
      in city z entails that x has location z

  description: 'Four definitional categories establish entity-relationship paradigms:
    Category I (entities-edges basic), Category II (graph-structured knowledge base),
    Category III (technical criteria including schema), Category IV (extensional/by
    example). Each implies different relationship semantics.'

  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:176-191)
    quote: defines possible classes and relations of entities in a schema; allows
      for potentially interrelating arbitrary entities with each other
  description: 'Paulheim''s criteria define schema-entity relationships: Schema ->
    definesClasses -> EntityTypes, Schema -> allowsRelations -> EntityRelations. Knowledge
    graphs allow arbitrary entity interrelation, distinguishing them from relational
    databases with stricter schema constraints.'
- name: Ontology-Reasoner Integration Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 13:196-211)
    quote: A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology
      and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge
  description: 'Ehrlinger and Woss define a key relationship: KnowledgeGraph -> integratesInto
    -> Ontology, Reasoner -> derives -> NewKnowledge. This distinguishes knowledge
    graphs from pure ontologies through reasoning capability.'
- name: Shape-Node Validation Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:5-7)
    quote: G is valid under Sigma and T if and only if there exists a shapes map sigma
      such that for all s in S and v in V it holds that sigma(v,s) equals the shape
      evaluation
  description: Shapes define validation relationships between nodes and constraints.
    The relationship is Node -> satisfies/violates -> Shape via ShapesMap. This enables
    declarative data quality validation in knowledge graphs.
- name: Quotient Graph Partition Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:45-72)
    quote: a quotient graph can merge multiple nodes into one node, where the merged
      node preserves the edges of its constituent nodes
  description: 'Quotient graphs define equivalence relationships: Nodes -> partitionedBy
    -> EquivalenceRelation -> formsQuotient -> MergedNode. The merged node preserves
    original edges, enabling schema abstraction through type-based or topology-based
    partitioning.'
- name: Simulation-Bisimulation Graph Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:77-98)
    quote: If a simulation exists on G and G', we say that G' simulates G... If a
      bisimulation exists on G and G', we say that they are bisimilar
  description: Simulation and bisimulation define structural relationships between
    graphs. Simulation is asymmetric (G' simulates G), while bisimulation is symmetric
    equivalence. These relationships preserve graph topology for schema derivation.
- name: Annotation Domain Semi-Ring Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:113-171)
    quote: An annotation domain is defined as an idempotent, commutative semi-ring
      D = <A, oplus, otimes, bottom, top>
  description: Annotated graphs add contextual relationships via semi-ring algebra.
    Edges become Edge -> annotatedWith -> Value from AnnotationDomain. The semi-ring
    operators define how annotations combine (oplus) and intersect (otimes), enabling
    temporal, fuzzy, or trust annotations.
- name: Interpretation-Model Satisfaction Relationship
  sources:

    quote: An interpretation I satisfies G if and only if... for all (u,l,v) in E,
      it holds that (u^I, l^I, v^I) in E_Gamma
  description: 'Graph interpretations define semantic relationships: Interpretation
    -> satisfies -> Graph when all edges map correctly to the domain graph. Interpretations
    that satisfy become Models, enabling semantic reasoning under UNA/NUNA assumptions.'
- name: Rule Body-Head Entailment Relationship
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 14:269-311)
    quote: A rule is a pair R = (B, H) such that B and H are graph patterns and Var(H)
      subset of B. We call B the body of the rule while we call H the head
  description: 'Rules define entailment relationships: Body -> entails -> Head when
    body patterns match. Rules are applied by substituting mappings from body evaluation
    into head, generating new edges. The least model captures all possible inferences.'

      A-Box: a set of assertional axioms; T is the T-Box: a set of class axioms; R
      is the R-Box: a set of relation axioms'
  description: 'DL knowledge bases structure relationships across three boxes: Individuals
    -> assertedIn -> A-Box, Classes -> definedIn -> T-Box, Relations -> constrainedIn
    -> R-Box. Class axioms (subclass, equivalence) and relation axioms (sub-property,
    transitivity) define the relationship semantics.'

      (process)
  description: 'W3C PROV establishes the foundational triad: Agent -> wasAssociatedWith

      enabling the system to learn over the course of a print
  description: 'Agent decisions form temporal chains: AgentDecision_i -> informs ->
    AgentDecision_i+1. This iterative relationship enables learning over time but
    also risk propagation where a single error compounds across subsequent decisions.'
- name: Provenance Query Traceability Relationship

      and Physics_Model_i
  description: 'Provenance enables backwards traceability: AgentDecision -> generatedBy
