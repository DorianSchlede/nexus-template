- name: Knowledge Graph Embeddings for ML Integration
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:769-778)
    quote: The main goal of knowledge graph embedding techniques is to create a dense
      representation of the graph in a continuous, low-dimensional vector space that
      can then be used for machine learning tasks
  description: Knowledge graphs can be transformed into dense numerical embeddings
    suitable for machine learning. This pattern enables AI/ML systems to consume graph-structured
    knowledge by mapping nodes and edges to continuous vector representations, bridging
    symbolic knowledge representation with neural approaches.
- name: Plausibility Scoring for Link Prediction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:807-822)
    quote: 'a specific embedding approach defines a scoring function that accepts
      entity embeddings and computes the plausibility of the edge: how likely it is
      to be true'
  description: Embedding models define scoring functions that output plausibility
    scores for edges, enabling AI systems to predict missing links and validate potential
    new knowledge. This supports automated knowledge graph completion and quality
    assessment.
- name: Graph Neural Networks for Supervised Learning
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:427-445)
    quote: 'A graph neural network (GNN) builds a neural network based on the topology
      of the data graph... GNNs support end-to-end supervised learning for specific
      tasks: given a set of labelled examples, GNNs can be used to classify elements
      of the graph'
  description: GNNs enable AI systems to perform supervised learning directly on graph-structured
    data by building neural architectures that follow the graph topology. This allows
    classification, prediction, and recommendation tasks that leverage both node features
    and graph structure.
- name: Deductive Reasoning with Ontologies
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 3:243-251)
    quote: Machines, in contrast, do not have a priori access to such deductive faculties;
      rather they need to be given formal instructions, in terms of premises and entailment
      regimes, in order to make similar deductions to what a human can make
  description: Ontologies provide formal entailment regimes that enable AI systems
    to perform logical deduction. This allows machines to derive new knowledge from
    existing facts and rules, supporting reasoning capabilities beyond pattern matching.
- name: Rule-Based Inference for Knowledge Derivation
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:21-35)
    quote: One of the most straightforward ways to provide automated access to deductive
      knowledge is through inference rules encoding if-then-style consequences. A
      rule is composed of a body (if) and a head (then)
  description: Inference rules enable automated knowledge derivation through if-then
    patterns. AI systems can apply rules recursively to derive new facts, supporting
    both forward-chaining (materialisation) and backward-chaining (query rewriting)
    reasoning strategies.
- name: Query Rewriting for Ontology-Aware Retrieval
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 4:92-109)
    quote: Another strategy is to use rules for query rewriting, which given a query,
      will automatically extend the query in order to find solutions entailed by a
      set of rules
  description: Query rewriting automatically extends user queries based on ontological
    rules to find all entailed solutions. This enables AI systems to perform semantic
    search that considers class hierarchies and property relationships, improving
    recall without materializing the full inference closure.
- name: Translational Embeddings for Relation Modeling
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:7-24)
    quote: Translational models interpret edge labels as transformations from subject
      nodes to object nodes; for example, the edge label bus is seen as transforming
      San Pedro to Moon Valley
  description: Translational embedding models (TransE and variants) represent relations
    as geometric transformations in vector space. This enables AI systems to capture
    semantic relationships through vector arithmetic, supporting analogical reasoning
    and relation-aware predictions.
- name: Tensor Decomposition for Latent Factor Discovery
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:63-78)
    quote: Tensor decomposition involves decomposing a tensor into more elemental
      tensors from which the original tensor can be recomposed by a fixed sequence
      of basic operations. These elemental tensors can be viewed as capturing latent
      factors
  description: Tensor decomposition methods enable AI systems to discover latent factors
    underlying graph structure. This supports dimensionality reduction while preserving
    relational patterns, enabling efficient representation learning for large knowledge
    graphs.
- name: Neural Plausibility Scoring with Non-Linear Functions
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:240-258)
    quote: A number of approaches rather use neural networks to learn embeddings with
      non-linear scoring functions for plausibility... Neural Tensor Networks (NTN),
      which rather proposes to maintain a tensor W of internal weights
  description: Neural network approaches enable more expressive plausibility scoring
    through non-linear activation functions and learned weight matrices. This allows
    AI systems to capture complex relational patterns that linear and bilinear models
    cannot represent.
- name: Convolutional Kernels for Graph Feature Extraction
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:260-280)
    quote: A number of more recent approaches have proposed using convolutional kernels
      in their models. ConvE proposes to generate a matrix from entity and relation
      embeddings by wrapping each vector over several rows
  description: Convolutional neural network techniques can be applied to knowledge
    graph embeddings, enabling hierarchical feature extraction through learned kernels.
    This pattern supports capturing local structural patterns in the embedding space.
- name: Language Model Integration via Graph Walks
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:310-328)
    quote: RDF2Vec performs biased random walks on the graph and records the paths
      as sentences, which are then fed as input into the word2vec model
  description: Knowledge graph embeddings can leverage pre-trained language model
    techniques by generating path sequences through random walks. This bridges graph
    structure with sequence-based language representations, enabling transfer of NLP
    techniques to graph domains.
- name: Entailment-Aware Embeddings with Rule Constraints
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:341-390)
    quote: KALE computes entity and relation embeddings using a translational model
      that is adapted to further consider rules using t-norm fuzzy logics
  description: Embedding models can incorporate logical rules as soft constraints
    during training, aligning inductive (embedding-based) and deductive (rule-based)
    reasoning. This enables AI systems to produce predictions that respect domain
    knowledge while benefiting from neural generalization.
- name: Symbolic Learning for Interpretable Models
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 02-Knowledge_Graphs (Chunk 5:667-690)
    quote: An alternative approach is to adopt symbolic learning in order to learn
      hypotheses in a symbolic language that explain a given set of positive and negative
      edges. These hypotheses then serve as interpretable models
  description: Symbolic learning methods extract logical rules and axioms from knowledge
    graphs, producing interpretable models that can be verified by domain experts.
    This addresses the explainability limitations of purely neural approaches.
- name: PROV-AGENT for AI Agent Provenance Tracking
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:117-125)
    quote: PROV-AGENT, a provenance model that extends the W3C PROV standard and incorporates
      concepts from the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to represent agent actions and
      their connections to data and workflow tasks
  description: PROV-AGENT extends W3C PROV to capture AI agent interactions including
    prompts, responses, and decisions within agentic workflows. This enables traceability,
    root cause analysis, and reliability assessment for LLM-based agent systems.
- name: Agent Tool Execution Modeling
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:285-296)
    quote: Following the MCP terminology, an AI agent can be associated with one or
      many tool executions (AgentTool) and each tool may be informed by one or many
      AIModelInvocations. Each AIModelInvocation uses a Prompt and a specific AIModel
  description: AI agents are modeled as executing tools that invoke AI models with
    prompts and receive responses. This structured representation enables capturing
    the full reasoning chain of agent decisions, supporting debugging and improvement
    of agent behavior.
- name: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Context
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:147-150)
    quote: agent-client architecture that can communicate with external sources, such
      as knowledge bases or web pages, for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
      dynamically augment prompts
  description: AI agents can enhance their prompts through RAG, retrieving relevant
    context from knowledge bases. This pattern connects ontological knowledge structures
    with generative AI systems, enabling grounded and contextually relevant agent
    outputs.
- name: Hallucination Tracing Through Provenance
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:182-191)
    quote: agentic provenance provides the glue power needed to unify these elements
      into a single, queryable graph. This enables traceability, root cause analysis,
      and continuous agent improvement, such as refining prompts or tuning model parameters
      to reduce hallucinations
  description: Provenance tracking enables tracing agent hallucinations back to their
    source prompts, inputs, and model parameters. This supports systematic improvement
    of AI agent reliability through prompt engineering and model fine-tuning.
- name: Cross-Facility Agent Workflow Integration
  sources:
  - chunk_ref: 03-PROV-AGENT (Chunk 1:151-159)
    quote: A growing challenge in these workflows involves managing execution across
      physically and logically distributed facilities that include edge devices, cloud
      services, and HPC systems
  description: AI agents operate across distributed computing environments (edge,
    cloud, HPC), requiring unified provenance to track agent decisions and their downstream
    impacts across facility boundaries. This enables end-to-end workflow transparency
    in heterogeneous deployments.
