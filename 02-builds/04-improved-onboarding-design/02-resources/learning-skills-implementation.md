## Executive Summary

The Nexus onboarding system consists of 6 interconnected learning skills that guide users through progressive system mastery. They form a sequential learning path from personalization through advanced system understanding, with built-in checkpoint system for auto-completion and contextual suggestion triggers.

**The 6 Skills:**
1. **setup-memory** (10 min, critical) - Personalization
2. **create-folders** (5-8 min, high) - Workspace organization
3. **learn-builds** (8-10 min, high) - Build vs skill distinction
4. **learn-skills** (10-12 min, high) - Skill-worthiness framework
5. **learn-integrations** (10-12 min, high) - MCP and external tools
6. **learn-nexus** (15-18 min, medium) - System mastery

**Total onboarding time**: 58-70 minutes (but progressive and optional after mandatory core)

---

## Sequential Onboarding Path

```
PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Sessions 1-2, MANDATORY)
├── setup-memory (10 min) ✓ Personalization
└── create-folders (5 min) ✓ Organization
    └── Checkpoint: "onboarding complete"

PHASE 2: BUILD-FIRST LEARNING (After First Build, AUTO-COMPLETE)
├── learn-builds (8 min) ✓ Auto-completes after first build created
└── learn-skills (10 min) ✓ Auto-completes after first task executed

PHASE 3: POWER-UP LEARNING (Optional, Contextual)
├── learn-integrations (10 min) ✓ Triggered by tool mentions
└── learn-nexus (15 min) ✓ Graduation skill
```

## SKILL 1: SETUP-MEMORY

### Purpose & Teaching
Transform smart defaults into personalized context. This is the **CRITICAL FIRST STEP** that makes Nexus understand your world.

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: setup-memory
description: "Configure Nexus memory with your role, goals, and context. Keywords: setup memory, personalize, configure, my goals, my role, about me, context upload. 10 min."
onboarding: true
priority: critical
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    setup_memory: true  # Marked in step 8 (finalization)

smart_default: true  # Removed during finalization (indicates personalization complete)
```

### Duration: 10-12 minutes

### Workflow Steps (8 total)
1. **Language preference** - Set communication language immediately
2. **Welcome & explain** - Context framing for why this matters
3. **Context upload** - Guide file collection via 04-workspace/context/
4. **Role discovery** - Interview about current role/position
5. **Long-term vision** - Capture 1-3 year aspirations
6. **Short-term goal** - Derive 3-month objective with metrics
7. **Work focus** - Define use case areas
8. **Finalization** - Save to goals.md, remove smart_default, mark complete

### SubAgent Context Analysis Pattern
- **1-3 files** → 1 SubAgent
- **4-8 files** → 2 SubAgents (parallel)
- **9+ files** → 3+ SubAgents (chunked)

SubAgent outputs (max 300 words):
- Person Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Professional Context (role, domain, skills)
- Work Context (projects, goals, themes)
- Relevant Terms (jargon, tools)
- Suggested Goals (3 AI-inferred directions)

### Output Structure (goals.md)
```markdown
## Current Role
[role from step 4]

## Short-Term Goal (3 months)
[goal with metrics from step 6]

## Long-Term Vision (1-3 years)
[vision from step 5]

## Work Style & Preferences
[from step 7]
```

### Trigger Phrases & Proactive Suggestions
- First session (always suggest if goals not set)
- User asks for help with work that needs context
- User mentions role, job, or what they do
- User expresses AI doesn't understand their context
- At menu display when `goals_personalized: false`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Language preference captured
- [ ] Context uploaded and analyzed (if provided)
- [ ] Role clearly defined
- [ ] Long-term vision captured
- [ ] Short-term goal specific and measurable
- [ ] Work focus defined
- [ ] `smart_default: true` removed
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.setup_memory: true`

## SKILL 2: CREATE-FOLDERS

### Purpose & Teaching
Design personalized workspace folder structure in `04-workspace/` based on user's work patterns. Teaches organizational principles:
1. **Process-based** (by status: inbox → active → done)
2. **Entity-based** (by thing: clients, projects, topics)
3. **Hybrid** (combination)

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: create-folders
description: "create folders, setup workspace, organize folders, where to put files."
onboarding: true
priority: high
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    create_folders: true  # Marked in step 7

workspace_configured: true  # Set in step 7
```

### Duration: 5-8 minutes

### Workflow Steps (7 total)
1. **Welcome & explain** - 04-workspace/ is your file space
2. **Understand patterns** - Interview about work types
3. **Design structure** - AI applies organizational principles
4. **Propose & iterate** - 3-7 folders, user refines
5. **Create folders** - mkdir commands
6. **Update workspace-map.md** - Document structure
7. **Finalize** - Mark complete

### Organization Principles

**Process-Based Example:**
```
├── inbox/      → What comes in
├── active/     → Working on now
├── done/       → Finished
└── archive/    → Old stuff
```
*Best for*: Clear workflows, pipelines

**Entity-Based Example:**
```
├── clients/    → One folder per client
├── projects/   → One folder per project
├── topics/     → One folder per topic
└── templates/  → Reusable stuff
```
*Best for*: Many similar things to track

**Hybrid Example:**
```
├── clients/
│   └── client-a/
│       ├── inbox/
│       ├── active/
│       └── done/
```

### Output Structure (workspace-map.md)
```markdown
# Workspace Map

> Your file organization in 04-workspace/
> Last updated: [date]

## Folder Structure
[folder tree with descriptions]

## Organization Principle
[Brief: process-based / entity-based / hybrid]

## Usage Notes
[User-specified notes]
```

### Trigger Phrases
- Just completed setup-memory (natural next step)
- User asks where to save files
- User creates files in wrong locations
- At menu display when `workspace_configured: false`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User understands 04-workspace/ purpose
- [ ] Work patterns understood
- [ ] 3-7 practical folders created
- [ ] workspace-map.md created
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.create_folders: true`
- [ ] `workspace_configured: true`

---

## SKILL 3: LEARN-BUILDS

### Purpose & Teaching
Understand when to create builds vs skills through:
- Concrete examples of what IS and ISN'T a build
- Decision framework (does it repeat?)
- Build structure and folder organization
- Build lifecycle states

**Core Teaching:** Builds END. Skills REPEAT.

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: learn-builds
description: "Learn how Nexus builds work. Load when user mentions: learn builds, how do builds work, builds vs skills, build tutorial, what is a build, build structure, build lifecycle, understand builds, explain builds. 8-10 min."
onboarding: true
priority: high
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    learn_builds: true  # Auto-completed when first build created

build_first:
  checkpoints:
    first_build_created: true  # Auto-completion trigger
```

**Auto-Completion Mechanism:** When user creates their first build, `learn_builds` is automatically marked complete. They learned by DOING.

### Duration: 8-10 minutes

### Workflow Steps (7 total)
1. **Concrete examples** - builds vs skills vs direction
2. **Decision framework** - Direction or Work? Does it repeat?
3. **Build structure** - folder layout
4. **Lifecycle states** - 4 states
5. **Practice** - user applies framework
6. **How to create** - command syntax
7. **Finalize** - mark complete

### Decision Framework (Core Teaching)

**Question 1: Direction or Work?**
- Direction = Goal (goes in goals.md)
- Work = Build or Skill

**Question 2: Does it repeat?**
- NO → BUILD (has endpoint)
- YES → SKILL (reusable)

**Anti-Pattern Detection:**
```
❌ WRONG: "weekly-report-week-1", "weekly-report-week-2", "weekly-report-week-3"
✅ RIGHT: ONE "weekly-report" SKILL used every week
```

### Build Structure
```
📁 02-builds/05-client-proposal/
├── 01-planning/
│   ├── overview.md     # What & why
│   ├── plan.md         # How
│   └── steps.md        # Tasks (checkboxes)
├── 02-resources/       # Reference materials
├── 03-working/         # Work in progress
└── 04-outputs/         # Final deliverables
```

### Build Lifecycle
**States:** PLANNING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED

### Trigger Phrases
- After first build - asks "how does this build system work?"
- User expresses confusion about builds vs skills
- Creates multiple similar "builds" (anti-pattern)
- Explicitly asks to learn/understand builds

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Understands build vs skill distinction
- [ ] Can apply decision framework
- [ ] Knows build folder structure
- [ ] Understands lifecycle states
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.learn_builds: true`

---

## SKILL 4: LEARN-SKILLS

### Purpose & Teaching
Identify skill-worthy workflows and understand skill structure. Teaches:
- 3-criteria skill-worthiness framework
- Skill structure and organization
- How skill triggering works
- Identifying repeating patterns

**Core Teaching:** Will you do this AGAIN? Yes = Skill.

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: learn-skills
description: "Learn how Nexus skills work. Load when user mentions: learn skills, how do skills work, what is a skill, skill tutorial, skill structure, understand skills, explain skills, when to create skill, skill vs build. 10-12 min."
onboarding: true
priority: high
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    learn_skills: true  # Auto-completed after first task execution

build_first:
  checkpoints:
    first_task_executed: true  # Auto-completion trigger
```

**Auto-Completion Mechanism:** When user completes their first section in execute-build, `learn_skills` is automatically marked complete.

### Duration: 10-12 minutes

### Workflow Steps (7 total)
1. **Concrete examples** - skills vs one-time work
2. **Skill-worthiness framework** - 3 criteria
3. **Skill structure** - folder layout
4. **Triggering mechanism** - YAML metadata matching
5. **Practice** - identify potential skills
6. **How to create** - command syntax
7. **Finalize** - mark complete

### Skill-Worthiness Framework (Core Teaching)

**Three Questions:**
1. **FREQUENCY:** 2+ times per month?
2. **REPEATABILITY:** Steps mostly the same?
3. **VALUE:** Saves >5 minutes per execution?

**Result:** ALL 3 YES = Skill-worthy | ANY NO = Just do manually

### Skill Structure
```
📁 weekly-status-report/
├── SKILL.md          # Instructions + triggers
├── references/       # Documentation (optional)
├── scripts/          # Automation (optional)
└── assets/           # Templates (optional)
```

### Trigger Mechanism

**Skill YAML Metadata:**
```yaml
name: weekly-status-report
description: "Load when user says 'status report', 'weekly update', 'progress summary'"
```

**Triggering Process:**
1. AI checks user message against ALL skill descriptions
2. Match found → skill loads
3. Multiple matches → prioritized

### Trigger Phrases
- Pattern detected - similar work repeated
- Creates multiple similar builds (anti-pattern)
- Describes repeating patterns ("every week I...")
- Explicitly asks about skills/automation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Understands skill vs build distinction
- [ ] Can apply 3-criteria framework
- [ ] Knows skill folder structure
- [ ] Understands trigger mechanism
- [ ] Identified at least one potential skill
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.learn_skills: true`

## SKILL 5: LEARN-INTEGRATIONS

### Purpose & Teaching
Learn how to connect external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Teaches:
- What MCP is and why it matters
- Available integrations and capabilities
- Integration decision framework
- How to add integrations

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: learn-integrations
description: "Learn about Nexus integrations and MCP. Load when user mentions: learn integrations, what is MCP, connect tools, integration tutorial, add integration, external tools, API connections, third party, how to integrate. 10-12 min."
onboarding: true
priority: high
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    learn_integrations: true  # Marked after step 8
```

### Duration: 10-12 minutes

### Workflow Steps (8 total)
1. **Why integrations** - discover current tools
2. **What is MCP** - universal adapter concept
3. **Available integrations** - built-in and MCP servers
4. **When to integrate** - decision framework
5. **How to add** - two methods
6. **Quick example** - Notion walkthrough
7. **What's next** - optionally set up now
8. **Finalize** - mark complete

### Available Integrations

**Built-In Master Skills:**
- Notion → "connect notion"
- Airtable → "connect airtable"
- Slack → "connect slack"
- Google → "connect google" (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Drive, Tasks, Slides)
- HubSpot → "connect hubspot"
- Beam.ai → "beam" commands

**MCP Servers (via add-integration):**
- GitHub, Linear, PostgreSQL, Filesystem
- 50+ more via MCP directory

### Integration Decision Framework

**Add Integration When:**
- Frequently copy-paste data from tool
- Want automated workflows
- Need real-time data
- Tool is central to daily work

**Skip When:**
- Rarely use the tool
- Manual copy-paste is fast enough
- Tool doesn't have MCP support
- Prefer keeping systems separate

**Key Message:** Nexus works perfectly standalone! Integrations are power-ups, not requirements.

### Trigger Phrases
- User mentions ANY external tool
- Says "I use..." or "I work with..." + tool name
- Asks about connecting/syncing/automating with external services
- Expresses frustration copying data between tools
- Asks "can you access..." or "connect to..."
- Mentions MCP, API, or integration

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Understands what MCP is
- [ ] Knows which integrations available
- [ ] Understands when to integrate vs standalone
- [ ] Knows commands to add integrations
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.learn_integrations: true`

## SKILL 6: LEARN-NEXUS

### Purpose & Teaching
Master Nexus philosophy and best practices. This is the **"graduation" skill** - system mastery.

Teaches:
- WHY Nexus works the way it does
- Design principles and philosophy
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid
- AI collaboration patterns and expert techniques

### Skill Metadata (YAML)
```yaml
name: learn-nexus
description: "Master Nexus philosophy and best practices. Load when user mentions: learn nexus, nexus tutorial, system mastery, nexus best practices, how nexus works, nexus philosophy, nexus design, understand nexus, nexus deep dive. 15-18 min."
onboarding: true
priority: medium
```

### Completion Tracking
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  completed:
    learn_nexus: true  # Marked after finalization
```

### Duration: 15-18 minutes

### Workflow Parts (7 sections + quiz)
- **Part A:** Living Knowledge Organism philosophy (3 min)
- **Part B:** 7 Problems Nexus Solves (4 min)
- **Part C:** 7 Design Principles (4 min)
- **Part D:** System Pitfalls (2 min)
- **Part E:** AI Collaboration Patterns (2 min)
- **Part F:** Expert Techniques (2 min)
- **Part G:** Mastery Check quiz (2 min)

### Part A: Living Knowledge Organism

**Core Concept:**
```
ALL FILES IN THIS SYSTEM ARE EXECUTABLE — NOT DOCUMENTATION!

Every .md file, .yaml config, and planning document is designed
to be READ, LOADED, and EXECUTED by AI in conversation.

This is not a static knowledge base. It's a living, breathing
organism that guides you through work.
```

### Part B: The 7 Problems Nexus Solves

1. **AI AMNESIA** - AI forgets everything
   → Solution: Memory files auto-load every session

2. **FILE CHAOS** - AI generates files randomly
   → Solution: 5-folder system with clear boundaries

3. **INCONSISTENT RESULTS** - AI improvises differently
   → Solution: Skills = saved workflows

4. **REPEATED WORK** - Build same workflow multiple times
   → Solution: Create skill once, reuse forever

5. **CONTEXT OVERLOAD** - Loading everything slows responses
   → Solution: Progressive loading (metadata first)

6. **HARD TO LEARN** - Steep learning curve
   → Solution: Optional onboarding, smart defaults

7. **IMMEDIATE EXECUTION** - AI builds before understanding
   → Solution: Planning mode → separate execution session

### Part C: The 7 Design Principles

1. **INSTRUCTION-DRIVEN** - Python script returns COMPLETE instructions, AI follows exactly
2. **YAML-DRIVEN AUTO-DETECTION** - Everything has metadata describing when to load
3. **SKILL-FIRST EXECUTION** - Skills have priority over builds
4. **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE** - Load minimum at start, more just-in-time
5. **STATE IN DATA FILES** - System state tracked in YAML and checkboxes
6. **CONTEXT PRESERVATION** - Nothing lost between sessions
7. **CONCRETE BEFORE ABSTRACT** - Experience first, explanation after

### Part D: System Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Builds Instead of Skills**
```
WRONG: weekly-report-week-1/, weekly-report-week-2/
RIGHT: weekly-report/ # ONE skill
```

**Pitfall #2: Skipping Close-Session**
Without "done": Progress not saved, learnings not captured

**Pitfall #3: Over-Organizing**
WRONG (day 1): 20 nested empty folders
RIGHT (day 1): 3-5 essential folders

### Part E: AI Collaboration Patterns

**Pattern #1: False Progress**
- AI: "Done! Files created." (But they don't exist)
- Detection: "Show me the files"

**Pattern #2: Incomplete Reads**
- AI reads 100 of 500 lines, misses critical info
- Detection: "Did you read ENTIRE file?"

**Pattern #3: Over-Engineering**
- You want simple, AI builds framework
- Detection: "Can this be simpler?"

### Part F: Expert Techniques

**Technique #1: "Yes, And..." Collaboration**
Evaluate AI additions, don't auto-accept/reject

**Technique #2: Intelligent Friction**
AI asks clarifying questions to prevent wasted effort

**Technique #3: The Planning Pattern**
```
Session 1 (Planning): Create structure, fill docs, NO IMPLEMENTATION
Session 2 (Execution): Load plans, execute with minimal intervention
```

### Part G: Mastery Check Quiz

**Q1:** Creating "expense-report-jan", "expense-report-feb"... Fix?
- Answer: ONE "expense-report" skill

**Q2:** AI says "Done! All files created." Response?
- Answer: "Show me the files"

**Q3:** What's the #1 design principle?
- Answer: Instruction-driven

### Trigger Phrases
- Completed other onboarding but not learn-nexus (graduation)
- Asks philosophical questions
- Encounters AI patterns (false progress, incomplete reads)
- Makes common mistakes
- Expresses interest in mastering system
- After 3+ sessions without this skill

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Understands Living Knowledge Organism philosophy
- [ ] Knows 7 problems Nexus solves
- [ ] Can name key design principles
- [ ] Knows 3 system pitfalls and fixes
- [ ] Can detect 3 AI behavior patterns
- [ ] Understands expert collaboration patterns
- [ ] Passed mastery check quiz
- [ ] `learning_tracker.completed.learn_nexus: true`

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Auto-Completion Checkpoint System

```yaml
build_first:
  checkpoints:
    first_build_created: true      # Triggers learn_builds auto-completion
    first_task_executed: true      # Triggers learn_skills auto-completion

auto_complete_map:
  setup_memory: null               # No auto-completion (explicit only)
  create_folders: null             # No auto-completion (explicit only)
  learn_builds: first_build_created
  learn_skills: first_task_executed
  learn_integrations: null         # No auto-completion (explicit only)
  learn_nexus: null                # No auto-completion (explicit only)
```

### Proactive Suggestion Strategy

**Trigger Levels:**
```
CRITICAL (Setup-Memory):
- First session
- Missing goals
- User asks for help
- At menu when not personalized

HIGH (Create-Folders):
- After setup-memory complete
- User asks about file organization
- At menu when not configured

HIGH (Learn-Integrations):
- User mentions any external tool
- After other onboarding complete
- User asks about connections

HIGH (Learn-Builds & Learn-Skills):
- Post-experience (after first build/task)
- Pattern detection (repeated work)
- Anti-pattern detection

MEDIUM (Learn-Nexus):
- After other onboarding complete
- Philosophical questions
- Common mistakes detected
- After 3+ sessions
```

### Persistence & State Management

**Tracked in user-config.yaml:**
```yaml
learning_tracker:
  session_count: 0
  completed:  # 6 boolean flags
    setup_memory: false
    create_folders: false
    learn_integrations: false
    learn_builds: false
    learn_skills: false
    learn_nexus: false
  dismissed: []
  last_suggested: null
  suggestion_preference: "normal"  # "aggressive", "normal", "gentle"

onboarding:
  status: "not_started"
  current_session: 0
  last_completed: null
  sessions_completed: []

first_encounters:
  build_created: false
  skill_loaded: false
  workspace_used: false
  memory_updated: false
  close_session_used: false
```

---

## IDENTIFIED GAPS & IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Gaps

1. **Prerequisite Validation**
   - No validation that setup-memory completes before create-folders
   - Recommendation: Add prerequisite check

2. **Progression Feedback**
   - No visual progress indicator across 6 skills
   - Recommendation: Add progress bar to menu

3. **Re-engagement for Dismissed Skills**
   - No re-engagement after dismissal
   - Recommendation: Add timestamp and re-suggest after 3+ weeks

4. **Contextual Pairing**
   - learn-builds and learn-skills should be paired
   - Recommendation: Add `related_skills` field

5. **Accessibility & Learning Styles**
   - All skills teach via conversational dialogue
   - Recommendation: Add visual diagrams, interactive walkthroughs

### Recommended Enhancements

**1. Add Progress Summary Command**
```
User: "show my learning progress"
Output:
  ✓ setup-memory (10 min)
  ✓ create-folders (5 min)
  → learn-builds (8 min, auto-completed)
  → learn-skills (10 min, auto-completed)
  ○ learn-integrations (10 min)
  ○ learn-nexus (15 min)

Total learned: 35 of 65 minutes
```

**2. Add Skip-with-Warning Pattern**
If user dismisses 2+ skills: offer 2-minute summary of key concepts

**3. Add "Learning Goals" to goals.md**
```markdown
## Learning Goals
- [ ] Understand builds vs skills
- [ ] Master skill triggering system
- [ ] Learn integration setup
- [ ] Understand Nexus philosophy
```

**4. Add Skill Interdependencies Map**
```yaml
skill_dependencies:
  create-folders:
    requires: [setup-memory]
  learn-integrations:
    recommends_after: [setup-memory, create-folders]
  learn-nexus:
    best_after: [learn-builds, learn-skills]
```

**5. Add "Graduation Certificate" on learn-nexus completion**
```
🎓 You've completed Nexus Mastery!

Earned skills:
✓ System Foundation (setup-memory, create-folders)
✓ Work Execution (learn-builds, learn-skills)
✓ Tool Integration (learn-integrations)
✓ System Philosophy (learn-nexus)

You're ready to build at full power!
```
